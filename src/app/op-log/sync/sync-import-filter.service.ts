/**
 * Service responsible for filtering operations invalidated by SYNC_IMPORT, BACKUP_IMPORT, or REPAIR operations.
 *
 * ## The Problem
 * ```
 * Timeline:
 *   Client A creates ops → Client B does SYNC_IMPORT → Client A syncs
 *
 * Result:
 *   - Client A's ops have higher serverSeq than SYNC_IMPORT
 *   - But they reference entities that were WIPED by the import
 *   - Applying them causes "Task not found" errors
 * ```
 *
 * ## The Solution: Clean Slate Semantics
 * SYNC_IMPORT and BACKUP_IMPORT are explicit user actions to restore ALL clients
 * to a specific state. ALL operations without knowledge of the import are dropped:
 *
 * - **GREATER_THAN / EQUAL**: Op was created with knowledge of import → KEEP
 * - **CONCURRENT**: Op was created without knowledge of import → DROP
 * - **LESS_THAN**: Op is dominated by import → DROP
 *
 * This ensures a true "restore to point in time" semantic. Concurrent work from
 * other clients is intentionally discarded because the user explicitly chose to
 * reset all state to the imported snapshot.
 *
 * We use vector clock comparison (not UUIDv7 timestamps) because vector clocks
 * track CAUSALITY (did the client know about the import?) rather than wall-clock
 * time (which can be affected by clock drift).
 */
/**
 * Detects whether a CONCURRENT comparison result is a pruning artifact rather
 * than genuine concurrency.
 *
 * When a new client joins after a SYNC_IMPORT that already has MAX_VECTOR_CLOCK_SIZE
 * entries, the new client's ops get an (MAX+1)-entry clock. The server prunes this
 * back to MAX, dropping one inherited entry. When other clients compare this pruned
 * clock with the import's clock, both have MAX entries with different unique keys,
 * causing compareVectorClocks to return CONCURRENT even though the op was created
 * AFTER the import with full causal knowledge.
 *
 * Detection criteria (all must be true):
 * 1. Op's clientId is NOT in import's clock → client was born after the import
 * 2. Import clock has >= MAX_VECTOR_CLOCK_SIZE entries (pruning only happens at MAX)
 * 3. There are shared keys between the clocks
 * 4. ALL shared keys have op values >= import values → client inherited import's knowledge
 *
 * Known limitation: A false positive is theoretically possible if the import clock
 * itself was pruned and a genuinely concurrent client's ID happened to be among the
 * pruned entries. In that scenario the client would appear "born after" the import
 * (criterion 1) even though it existed before. This is unlikely in practice because
 * it requires the concurrent client to be one of the oldest (least-recently-updated)
 * entries in the import clock at the time of pruning.
