/**
 * Orchestrates synchronization of the Operation Log with remote storage.
 *
 * ## Overview
 * This service is the main coordinator for syncing operations between clients.
 * It handles uploading local changes, downloading remote changes, detecting conflicts,
 * and ensuring data consistency across all clients.
 *
 * ## Sync Flow
 * ```
 * ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 * │                           UPLOAD FLOW                                   │
 * ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
 * │  1. Check if fresh client (block upload if no history)                 │
 * │  2. Upload pending ops via OperationLogUploadService                   │
 * │  3. Process piggybacked ops FIRST (triggers conflict detection)        │
 * │  4. Mark server-rejected ops as rejected                               │
 * └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

 * │  2. Fresh client? → Show confirmation dialog                           │

 * │  1. Schema migration (receiver-side)                                   │
 * │  2. Filter ops invalidated by SYNC_IMPORT                              │
 * │  3. Full-state op? → Skip conflict detection, apply directly           │
 * │  4. Conflict detection via vector clocks                               │
 * │  5. Conflicts? → Auto-resolve with LWW, piggyback non-conflicting ops  │
 * │  6. No conflicts? → Apply ops directly                                 │
 * │  7. Validate state (Checkpoint D)                                      │
 * └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 * ```
 *
 * ## Key Concepts
 *
 * ### Piggybacked Operations
 * When uploading, the server may return ops from other clients in the same response.
 * These are processed BEFORE marking rejected ops so conflict detection works properly.
 *
 * ### Non-Conflicting Ops Piggybacking
 * When conflicts are detected, non-conflicting ops are passed to ConflictResolutionService
 * to be applied together with resolved conflicts. This ensures dependency sorting works
 * (e.g., Task depends on Project from a resolved conflict).
 *
 * ### Fresh Client Safety
 * A client with no history must download before uploading to prevent overwriting
 * valid remote data with empty state. Fresh clients also see a confirmation dialog.
 *
 * ## Delegated Services
 * - **OperationLogUploadService**: Handles server communication for uploads
 * - **OperationLogDownloadService**: Handles server communication for downloads
 * - **ConflictResolutionService**: Presents conflicts to user and applies resolutions
 * - **VectorClockService**: Manages vector clock state and entity frontiers
 * - **OperationApplierService**: Applies operations to NgRx store
 * - **ValidateStateService**: Validates and repairs state after sync (Checkpoint D)

   * 2. Process piggybacked ops FIRST → triggers conflict detection with local pending ops
   * 3. THEN mark server-rejected ops as rejected (if not already resolved via conflict dialog)

   * This order ensures users see conflict dialogs when the server rejects their changes,

   * SAFETY: A wholly fresh client (no snapshot, no operations) should NOT upload.
   * Fresh clients must first download and apply remote data before they can contribute.
   * This prevents scenarios where a fresh/empty client overwrites existing remote data.
   *
   * SERVER MIGRATION: When a client with history connects to an empty server for the
   * first time (server migration scenario), we create a SYNC_IMPORT with full state
   * before uploading regular ops. This ensures all data is transferred to the new server.
