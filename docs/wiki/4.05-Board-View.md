# Board View

A **board** provides a visual, column-based way to organize tasks. Boards let you view and organize tasks from different perspectives using configurable columns (like Kanban or an Eisenhower Matrix) without changing the underlying task data.

## What Problem Boards Solve

Boards solve the problem of **visual task organization**. They provide flexible, filterable columns that let you see tasks organized in different ways—by status, priority, urgency, or any other criteria you configure—while keeping the same underlying tasks.

For example, you might have a Kanban board with "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done" columns, or an Eisenhower Matrix with "Urgent & Important", "Not Urgent & Important", "Urgent & Not Important", and "Not Urgent & Not Important" quadrants.

## How Boards Work

Boards are made up of **panels** (columns). Each panel has:

- **Filters** that determine which tasks appear in that panel (by tags, completion status, scheduling, project, backlog status, etc.)
- **Ordering** that you control by dragging and dropping tasks within the panel
- **Automatic updates** that modify task properties when you move tasks between panels

## Moving Tasks Between Columns

When you drag a task from one panel to another, the app automatically updates the task to match the target panel's configuration:

- **Tags** are added or removed based on the panel's tag filters
- **Completion status** is updated (marked done or undone) based on the panel's setting
- **Project assignment** is updated if the panel specifies a project
- **Scheduling** is updated (scheduled or unscheduled) based on the panel's setting

This means moving a task to a "Done" panel marks it complete, and moving it to a panel that requires certain tags adds those tags to the task.

## Multiple Boards and Task Membership

Tasks can appear on **multiple boards simultaneously**. This works because:

- Each board panel independently filters all tasks based on its criteria
- Tasks don't store which boards they belong to—membership is calculated dynamically
- Each panel maintains its own ordering, so a task can be in different positions on different boards

For example, a task might appear in the "Urgent" column of an Eisenhower Matrix board and also in the "In Progress" column of a Kanban board, with different positions in each.

## Boards Vs Projects Vs Tags

| Feature               | Boards                             | Projects                          | Tags                                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**           | Visual organization with columns   | Task grouping and structure       | Cross-cutting categorization           |
| **Task Relationship** | Dynamic filtering-based membership | Direct assignment (required)      | Direct assignment (optional, multiple) |
| **Visual**            | Column-based layout                | Tree view in sidebar              | Badge display on tasks                 |
| **Persistence**       | Board configurations are saved     | Project data and task assignments | Tag data and task assignments          |

Boards provide a flexible visual layer on top of your existing task-project-tag structure. They let you create multiple simultaneous views of the same tasks without duplicating the underlying task data.

## Default Boards

The app includes two default boards:

- **Eisenhower Matrix** — Organizes tasks by urgency and importance (4 quadrants)
- **Kanban** — Organizes tasks by workflow stage (To Do, In Progress, Done)

You can create custom boards with your own panels and filters to match your workflow.
