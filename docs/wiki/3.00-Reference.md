# How to Write `Reference Material`
The `3.XX` sections should strive to follow these [[https://docs.openedx.org/en/open-release-sumac.master/documentors/concepts/content_types.html#id5]].

- Do nothing but describe. References have one job: **to explain** and do that **accurately and comprehensively**.    
- **Be accurate.** These descriptions must be accurate and kept up-to-date.    
- **Provide examples.** It is a valuable way of providing illustrations that help readers understand the references without becoming distracted from the job of describing them.    
- **The documentation structure should mirror the product’s structure** so the user can work their way through it simultaneously. It doesn’t mean forcing the documentation into an unnatural structure. What’s important is that the documentation should help make sense of the product.
- **Be consistent** in structure, language, terminology, and tone.
