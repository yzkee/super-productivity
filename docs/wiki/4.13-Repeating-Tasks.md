# Repeating Tasks

Repeating tasks in Super Productivity are tasks that recur on a schedule—daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly—so you don’t have to create the same task over and over. The app stores a **repeat configuration** that defines the pattern, then automatically creates new task instances when they are due. Understanding how repeating tasks are defined, when the next instance is created, and how the app avoids duplicates and handles skipped dates helps you use them reliably in the Planner, Schedule, and Today View.

For how to create, edit, and manage repeating tasks in the UI, see [[2.06-Manage-Repeating-Tasks]]. For how the repeat configuration fits into the task model, see [[4.09-Task-Attributes]]. Repeating tasks cannot be made into subtasks; see [[4.11-Subtasks]].

## How Repeating Tasks Are Defined and Stored

A repeating task is defined by a **repeat configuration** linked to the task. The configuration is stored separately and describes the pattern. Key options you can set include:

- **Repeat cycle** — How often the task recurs: daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.
- **Repeat interval** — How many units between instances (for example “every 2 weeks” or “every 3 months”).
- **Start date** — When the pattern begins; the app does not create instances before this date.
- **Last created instance** — The app tracks the most recent date for which a task instance was created so it knows what to create next.
- **Skipped dates** — You can mark specific dates as “skipped” so no instance is created on those days; the pattern continues before and after. That lets you skip a holiday, a day off, or a one-off exception without changing the rule.
- **Start time and reminder** — Optional: a default time (and reminder) for each instance, so recurring work appears at a fixed time on the Schedule.
- **Subtask templates** — Optional: a set of subtasks that are added to each new instance so you don’t have to recreate the same checklist every time.

The app also offers **quick settings** that map to common patterns—for example “daily,” “weekly on this weekday,” “monthly on this date,” “weekdays only” (Monday–Friday), “yearly on this date,” or “custom” for full control. These are shortcuts that fill in the underlying cycle, interval, and (for weekly) which weekdays.

When you make a task repeatable, it keeps its project, tags, and other attributes; the repeat configuration is added and the app uses it to generate future instances.

## What Triggers the Next Instance Creation

The app creates the **next task instance** when it detects that an instance is due and does not yet exist. It does this by:

1. **Looking at the pattern** — From the repeat configuration (cycle, interval, start date, last created instance), the app works out the most recent date when a task _should_ have been created, working backwards from today (or from a chosen “up to” date). That determines which dates are “missing” and need an instance.
2. **Checking each candidate date** — For each such date, the app checks that no instance already exists for that date (and that the date is not in your skipped-dates list). If an instance is missing, it creates one.
3. **Updating the configuration** — After creating an instance, the app updates “last created instance” so it doesn’t create another one for the same date. That keeps the pattern in sync and avoids duplicates.

When you **first** make a task repeatable, the app computes the **first occurrence** date from the pattern and start date. It may set the task’s due date to that first occurrence and, if the first occurrence is not today, remove the task from the Today list so it appears on the correct day instead. That way the first instance aligns with the repeat rule from the start.

Instance creation runs as part of normal app use (for example when you open the app or switch context), so overdue instances are created when the app catches up. You don’t have to trigger creation manually unless your workflow exposes a “create next instance” action.

## How the App Prevents Duplicates and Handles Exceptions

The app uses several mechanisms so you don’t get duplicate instances and so sync and skipped dates behave correctly.

### Deterministic Task IDs

Each repeat instance is created with a **predictable ID** derived from the repeat configuration and the date. That means the same configuration and the same date always produce the same task ID on every device. When you sync (for example via WebDAV or Dropbox), two devices that both run the “create instance for this date” logic will create tasks with the same ID, so sync sees one task, not two. That prevents duplicates across devices.

### Duplicate Checks Before Creating

Before creating an instance for a given date, the app:

1. **Checks for an existing instance** — It looks for a task that either has the expected deterministic ID or has that date as its due date. If one exists (for example created on another device and already synced, or an older “legacy” task with a different ID but the same date), it does not create another. That covers both new and legacy data.
2. **Checks skipped dates** — If the date is in your list of skipped (deleted) instances, the app does not create a task for that date. The pattern continues; that date is simply omitted.
3. **Updates “last created”** — After a successful create, the app updates the configuration’s “last created instance” so the next run knows not to create again for that date.

Together, these steps keep at most one instance per date per repeat configuration, locally and when synced.

### Skipped Dates (Exceptions)

You can **skip specific occurrences** without changing the repeat rule. Those dates are stored in the configuration’s exception list. The app never creates an instance for those dates, but it does create instances for all other dates that match the pattern. So you can skip a single day (or several) and the rest of the schedule stays the same.

## Repeating Tasks in the Schedule and Planner

The **Schedule** view can show **projected** instances of repeating tasks (with a start time set) even before the actual task instance is created. That gives you a forward-looking timeline: you see when the next “standup” or “review” will occur according to the pattern. Once the instance is created, it appears as a normal task on the Schedule. See [[4.04-Schedule-View]].

The **Planner** view also shows recurring task projections on the days they will occur, so you can see how repeating work fits into the week or month. See [[4.03-Planner-View]].

Date calculations for repeat patterns use a consistent reference time (noon) internally to avoid timezone and daylight-saving issues, so the “next occurrence” stays correct across timezones and DST changes.

## Summary

- Repeating tasks are defined by a **repeat configuration** (cycle, interval, start date, skipped dates, optional time and subtask templates).
- The app **creates the next instance** when it detects a due date with no instance yet, then updates “last created” so it doesn’t duplicate.
- **Deterministic IDs** (config + date) prevent duplicate instances when syncing across devices.
- **Skipped dates** let you omit specific occurrences without breaking the pattern.
- The **Schedule** (and Planner) can show projected repeat instances; actual instances appear once created.
