# Manage Repeating Tasks

For how repeat configuration works and when instances are created, see [[4.13-Repeating-Tasks]].

## Open the Recurring Task Dialog (add or edit)

**From a task:** Open the task (click it so the task detail panel opens on the right). In the panel, find the **Repeat** row (repeat icon and "Repeat" label). Click the **add** (plus) or **edit** (pencil) control on that row. The dialog opens with the title **Add Recurring Task Config** (new) or **Edit Recurring Task Config** (existing). Only main tasks (not subtasks) and non–issue-linked tasks show the Repeat row; tasks imported from Jira or Git cannot be recurring.

**From the scheduled list:** Go to the **Scheduled tasks** page (e.g. via **Shift+S** or the **Go to scheduled tasks** shortcut). In the **Recurring Tasks** section, each recurring task is shown as a card. Click the card (the line with the repeat icon and the recurrence text) to open the **Edit Recurring Task Config** dialog for that configuration.

You can also open the dialog from a repeating task instance or from a repeat projection on the Schedule or Planner (e.g. by clicking the repeat icon or the event).

## Create a New Repeating Task

1. Open a **main task** (not a subtask, not from an issue) and open the **Repeat** row in the task detail panel (see above). The dialog title is **Add Recurring Task Config**.
2. Enter the **Task title** (or keep the task’s current title, which is often pre-filled).
3. In **Recurring Config**, choose a quick setting:
   - Every day
   - Every Monday through Friday
   - Every week on &lt;weekday&gt; (e.g. every week on Wednesday)
   - Every month on the day &lt;date&gt;
   - Every year on &lt;day and month&gt;
   - Custom recurring config — then use the extra fields (see below).
4. For **Custom**, set:
   - Recur every — number (1–1000).
   - Recur cycle — Day, Week, Month, or Year.
   - Schedule type (only for intervals &gt; 1): Fixed schedule (every X from start date) or After completion (X after I finish).
   - Start date — when the pattern begins (required).
   - For weekly cycle: check the weekdays (Monday–Sunday) on which the task should recur.
5. Optionally set **Tags to add** (chip list).
6. Optionally set **Scheduled start time** (e.g. 15:00; leave blank for all-day). If you set a time, **Remind at** appears — choose when to be reminded (e.g. when it starts, 5 minutes before).
7. Optionally set **Default Estimate** (duration). **Order** (number) controls creation order when several recurring tasks are created at the same time; see the field description in the dialog.
8. In the advanced section: **Default notes**, **Inherit subtasks** (copy subtasks from the latest instance to the next), and, if inherit is on, **Disable auto-updating subtasks** (do not update inherited subtasks when the newest instance changes).
9. Click **Save**. New instances are created according to the pattern when you open the project or the app.

## Add a time and Reminder to a Repeating Task

1. Open the recurring task config (task detail panel → Repeat, or scheduled list → click the recurring task card).
2. Set **Scheduled start time** (e.g. 15:00). Leave it blank for an all-day task.
3. When a time is set, **Remind at** appears. Choose an option (e.g. when it starts, 5 minutes before it starts).
4. Click **Save**.

## Set a Default time Estimate for Instances

In the recurring task dialog, set **Default Estimate** (duration). New instances will use this estimate unless you change it per task. Click **Save**.

## Add Tags to a Recurring Task Configuration

In the dialog, use **Tags to add** to add one or more tags. New instances will have these tags. Click **Save**.

## Inherit Subtasks in New Instances

1. Open the recurring task config.
2. Enable **Inherit subtasks**. The description explains that subtasks from the most recent task instance will be recreated with the recurring task.
3. Optionally enable **Disable auto-updating subtasks** so that when you change the template subtasks on the newest instance, existing instances are not updated automatically.
4. Click **Save**.

## Edit a Recurring Task Configuration

Open the config (from the task’s **Repeat** row in the detail panel, or from the **Recurring Tasks** section on the scheduled list by clicking the card). Change **Task title**, **Recurring Config**, **Start date**, weekdays, **Scheduled start time**, **Remind at**, **Default Estimate**, **Order**, **Default notes**, tags, or inherit options. Click **Save**.

## Delete a Single Instance (e.g. “today only”)

1. Open the **Edit Recurring Task Config** dialog for that recurring task (e.g. from a task instance or from the scheduled list).
2. If the instance for today (or for the date you opened from) can be removed, a button appears: **Remove today** or **Remove for &lt;date&gt;**. Click it to delete only that instance. The repeat configuration and other instances are unchanged.

## Delete the Entire Recurring Task (stop All Future instances)

1. Open the **Edit Recurring Task Config** dialog.
2. Click **Remove**. This removes the repeat configuration. Future instances will no longer be created; existing task instances remain until you delete them separately.
