# Sync Integration Comparison

This reference compares the **sync providers** available in Super Productivity: how each stores and syncs your data, which platforms they support, how authentication works, and whether optional encryption is available. Use it to choose a sync provider or to understand how your data moves between devices.

For an overview of how integrations work (issue providers and sync providers), see [[4.24-Integrations]]. For conflict handling, backup behavior, and where data is stored, see [[4.23-Managing-Your-Data]] and [[3.06-User-Data]]. For a comparison of **issue** providers (Jira, GitHub, etc.), see [[3.07-Issue-Integration-Comparison]].

## What Sync Providers Do

Sync providers **synchronize your full Super Productivity data** (tasks, projects, tags, time tracking, settings, archives, and so on) between this app instance and a remote location or another device. They do **not** import issues from Jira, GitHub, or other issue trackers; those are handled by issue providers. All sync in the app is **local-first** and **operation-based**: your device holds the primary copy, and changes are sent as operations (or a sync file containing state and operations) to the remote side. You configure one sync provider at a time.

## Comparison Summary

| Provider         | Platform     | Authentication                  | Optional encryption         | Typical use                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| WebDAV           | All          | URL, username, password         | Yes (client-side key)       | Nextcloud, ownCloud, other WebDAV servers    |
| Dropbox          | All          | OAuth 2.0 (no password stored)  | Yes (client-side key)       | Cloud backup, cross-device sync              |
| SuperSync (beta) | All          | URL, username/password or token | Yes (E2E, server-supported) | Dedicated sync server, self-hosted or hosted |
| Local file       | Desktop only | None (folder path)              | Yes (client-side key)       | Local or network folder backup               |

**Note:** SuperSync is very new and is still in beta. Prefer WebDAV, Dropbox, or local file for production use until SuperSync is stable.

## Per-Provider Details

### WebDAV

- **Compatible with:** Nextcloud, ownCloud, and any WebDAV-compatible server.
- **Configuration:** Base URL, username, password, and an optional sync folder path on the server.
- **Encryption:** Optional client-side encryption; you set an encryption key that is not sent to the server.
- **Platform:** Available on desktop (Electron), web, and mobile. In the browser, CORS can block WebDAV requests; the app may recommend the desktop version for reliable sync.

### Dropbox

- **Configuration:** OAuth 2.0; you sign in with your Dropbox account. No username/password for Dropbox is stored in the app; the app stores tokens after you authorize.
- **Encryption:** Optional client-side encryption; you set an encryption key. Data can be stored encrypted in your Dropbox so that only this app (with the key) can read it.
- **Platform:** Available on desktop, web, and mobile.

### SuperSync (beta)

- **What it is:** A dedicated sync server designed for Super Productivity. Can be self-hosted or used with a hosted instance. **SuperSync is very new and is still in beta;** consider WebDAV, Dropbox, or local file for production use until it is stable.
- **Configuration:** Server base URL, then either username/password or an access token; optional sync folder path. Optional **end-to-end encryption** can be enabled on the server side so that the server stores only encrypted data.
- **Encryption:** Optional; when enabled, the server supports E2E encryption. You manage the encryption key; the server does not see plain data.
- **Platform:** Available on desktop, web, and mobile. Sync uses the same operation-based model as other providers but talks directly to the SuperSync server (no intermediate file in a generic cloud folder).

### Local file sync

- **What it is:** Writes the sync file to a local or network-accessible folder (e.g. a shared drive or NAS).
- **Configuration:** Folder path only; no remote account.
- **Encryption:** Optional client-side encryption with a key you set.
- **Platform:** **Desktop (Electron) only.** Not available in the web app or mobile, because those environments cannot reliably access arbitrary local or network paths.

## Choosing a Provider

- **WebDAV** — Use if you already have Nextcloud, ownCloud, or another WebDAV server and want one place for files and app sync.
- **Dropbox** — Use for cloud-backed sync without running your own server; OAuth keeps account credentials out of the app config.
- **SuperSync (beta)** — Use when you want a dedicated sync service and optional server-side E2E encryption. Bear in mind it is very new and still in beta.
- **Local file** — Use on desktop when you want sync to a local or network folder (e.g. backup to an external drive or NAS) without using the cloud.

Conflict resolution (e.g. when two devices change the same data) is the same for all providers: the app uses last-write-wins or prompts you when appropriate. See [[4.23-Managing-Your-Data]].
