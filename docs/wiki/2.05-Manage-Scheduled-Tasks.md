# Manage Scheduled Tasks

For how scheduled tasks appear in the Today View and Schedule, see [[4.12-Scheduled-Tasks]] and [[4.01-The-Today-View]].

## Open the Schedule Dialog

**From the context menu:** Right-click the task. At the top of the menu you will see icon buttons: **Schedule today** (sun), **Schedule tomorrow**, **Schedule next week**, and a **calendar (today)** icon. Click the **calendar icon** to open the full schedule dialog. The tooltip shows "Schedule task" or "Reschedule" if the task is already scheduled, and the default keyboard shortcut **S** if one is set.

**With the keyboard:** Focus the task (click it or use the arrow keys), then press **S** (default shortcut for "Schedule task"). See [[3.03-Keyboard-Shortcuts]] and [[3.02-Settings-and-Preferences]] to change or confirm the key.

## Schedule a Task for a Specific Day

1. Open the schedule dialog (see above).
2. In the dialog, either click a **date** in the calendar or use the quick-access icons at the top (sun = today, tomorrow, next week, moon = next month) to set the date. The selected date is highlighted.
3. Click the **Schedule** button at the bottom. The task is due on that day with no specific time.

## Schedule a Task with a Specific time

1. Open the schedule dialog.
2. Select the **date** in the calendar.
3. In the **Time** field (clock icon), enter a time in HH:MM (e.g. 09:00 for 9am or 21:00 for 9pm). You can use the time picker or type the value. To clear the time, click the **X** (close) icon on the right of the field.
4. Click **Schedule**. The task appears at that time on the Schedule view.

## Quickly Schedule for Today, Tomorrow, or next Week (without Opening the dialog)

Right-click the task. At the top of the context menu, click one of the icon buttons:

- **Sun icon** — **Schedule today** (schedules for today only; no time).
- **Tomorrow icon** — **Schedule tomorrow**.
- **Next week icon** — **Schedule next week** (first day of the next week according to your locale).

The task is scheduled immediately and the menu closes. To pick any date or set a time, use the calendar icon to open the full dialog instead.

## Set a Reminder for a Scheduled Task

1. Open the schedule dialog and set a **Time** for the task. The **Remind at** dropdown only appears when a time is set.
2. In **Remind at**, choose when you want to be reminded. Options in the app are: **Never**, **when it starts**, **5 minutes before it starts**, **10 minutes before it starts**, **15 minutes before it starts**, **30 minutes before it starts**, **1 hour before it starts**.
3. Click **Schedule**.

## Remove Scheduling from a Task

**From the context menu (if the task is already scheduled):** Right-click the task. Next to the calendar icon there is an **Unschedule task** button (event_busy icon). Click it to clear the due date and time.

**From the schedule dialog:** Open the schedule dialog for the task. If the task already has a due date or time, an **Unschedule** button (with alarm_off or event_busy icon) appears. Click **Unschedule** to remove the schedule.

**With the keyboard:** Focus the task and press **U** (default shortcut for "Unschedule task"), if configured. See [[3.03-Keyboard-Shortcuts]].
