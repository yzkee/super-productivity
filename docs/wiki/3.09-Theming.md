# Theming

Custom theming is supported on **desktop (Electron)** only. You load a single custom CSS file that overrides or extends the app's styles.

## How it Works

- Place a file named **`styles.css`** in your user data folder (not in a subfolder). The app loads it at startup and injects it into the renderer.
- Where that folder is and how to find it: [[3.06-User-Data]]. Invalid CSS may fail to load and is logged.
