# Tags: Ordinal-Priorities

Super Productivity does not have the concept of "ordinal priorities". That is, there is no way to mark a task as "High-Low" or "1 to 5" and be able to sort by that value.

By tagging tasks you can approximate this functionality. For certain tag types you could use a prefix to make it easier to filter them. For example, your tags might look like:

- `#P1 #P2 #P3 #P4` (P for priority)
- `#I-LOW #I-MED #I-HIGH` (I for importance)
