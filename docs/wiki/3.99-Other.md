## Web-App-Limitations

Time tracking only works if the app is open and for idle time tracking to work, the chrome extension must be installed.

If you want the Jira integration and idle time tracking to work, you also have to download and install the [Super Productivity Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/super-productivity/ljkbjodfmekklcoibdnhahlaalhihmlb).

### JSON-Models

### Wayland-Compatibility

If you're experiencing issues running Super Productivity on Wayland (such as rendering problems, VSync errors, or GLib-GObject warnings), you can force the application to use X11 mode by starting it with the `--force-x11` parameter:

```bash
superproductivity --force-x11
```

This will automatically apply compatibility fixes including:

- Forcing the Ozone platform to use X11 instead of Wayland
- Disabling GPU VSync to prevent GetVSyncParametersIfAvailable() errors
- Setting the appropriate environment variables for X11 compatibility

The application will automatically detect Wayland sessions and apply these fixes, but you can use this flag if automatic detection doesn't work properly.

#### Idle Time

I have created a [simple solution to idle time on Wayland](https://github.com/zenoprax/xprintidle-wayland-shim). It is an unofficial hack/workaround that has been working fine for me. Use at your own risk!
