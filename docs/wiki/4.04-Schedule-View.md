# Schedule View

The **Schedule** view shows a time-based timeline of how your planned tasks unfold over time. It distinguishes between **scheduled tasks** (shown at specific times) and **regular tasks** (flowing around fixed events), helping you see how work fits into your day.

## What the Schedule Shows

The Schedule automatically generates a timeline from your tasks using the time estimates you've assigned. It shows the upcoming 30 days and displays:

- **Scheduled tasks** — Tasks with a specific due time, shown at that time
- **Regular tasks** — Tasks without a fixed time that "flow" around scheduled events
- **Recurring task projections** — Instances of repeating tasks
- **Tasks planned for specific days** — Tasks you've assigned to certain days
- **Calendar events** — Events from external calendars you've connected

## Scheduled Vs Regular Tasks

The Schedule treats tasks in two ways:

- **Scheduled tasks** — Have a specific date and time. They appear at that time on the timeline.
- **Regular tasks** — Have no specific time. They flow around scheduled tasks, using your time estimates to show how they might fit into the day.

If you set work start and end times in settings, regular tasks are only shown within that range—they never appear outside your configured work day.

## How Tasks Are Ordered

Tasks are ordered by **start time**. When two or more tasks share the same start time, the app orders them by type (scheduled tasks first, then regular tasks).

## Blocked Time and Long-Running Tasks

**Blocked periods** (for example lunch breaks) can be added to the Schedule. When a task would run through a blocked period, it is shown as **split**: one segment up to the block, then a continued segment after it. That keeps the timeline readable and shows when work resumes.

Tasks that run past midnight are continued on the next day, so you see the full span of the work.

## What You See

The Schedule shows a range of days (the upcoming 30 days). How many days are visible at once depends on your screen size and the view mode (week or month): fewer on narrow screens, more on wide ones.

## Planning Vs Scheduling

**Planning** (in the Planner view) assigns tasks to days without specific times. **Scheduling** (in the Schedule view) assigns both a date and a specific time:

- When you schedule a task with time, it gets a due date and time
- Scheduled tasks are removed from the Planner (they belong in the Schedule instead)
- Tasks scheduled for today automatically appear in the Today View
- You can reschedule tasks or move them to the backlog when needed
