# Manage Task Integrations

This how-to describes how to set up and use issue integrations (Jira, GitHub, GitLab, and others) to import and sync tasks from external systems. For an overview of how integrations work, see [[4.24-Integrations]]. For a comparison of which issue provider supports worklogs, status transitions, subtasks, and other features, see [[3.07-Issue-Integration-Comparison]].
