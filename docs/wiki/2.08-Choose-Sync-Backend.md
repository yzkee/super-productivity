# Choose Sync Backend

Sync backs up and synchronizes your full Super Productivity data (tasks, projects, time tracking, settings, archives, and so on) between this app and a remote location or another device. You configure **one** sync provider per device; each device can use a different provider (the **Sync provider** setting is not synced between devices). For a detailed comparison of providers, see [[3.08-Sync-Integration-Comparison]]. For how to configure the one you choose, see [[2.09-Configure-Sync-Backend]].

It is not a requirement to use any sync backend if you only use Super Productivity on a single device. Ensure that you have backups configured and that you know how to [[2.02-Restore-Data-From-Backup]] in case of data corruption from other errors.

## Sync is in transition

The app is moving to a new **operation-based** sync model (changes are sent as operations instead of full data blobs). **SuperSync** is the backend built for this model and is where new development is focused. The other providers (Dropbox, WebDAV, Local file) use the current file-based sync and remain **supported**. The word “legacy” in the code refers to the older technical implementation, **not** to deprecation or removal—the developer has stated that WebDAV and Local file are very likely to remain available for the foreseeable future. Choose the option that fits your setup and risk tolerance.

## What the labels mean

In the **Sync provider** dropdown you will see:

- **SuperSync (Beta)** — The new sync service built for the operation-based protocol. Actively developed; real-time sync and optional server-side end-to-end encryption. **Beta** means it is still being stabilized; some users prefer a file-based option until SuperSync is out of beta.
- **Dropbox** — File-based sync via your Dropbox account. OAuth sign-in; no password stored in the app. Widely used and stable; not deprecated.
- **WebDAV (experimental)** — Sync via any WebDAV-compatible server (e.g. Nextcloud, ownCloud). Labeled **experimental** because WebDAV implementations differ a lot between providers: the app is known to work well with Nextcloud for many users, but it may not work with every WebDAV server out of the box. The label is there so you are aware things might not work smoothly with every provider; the option is not being removed.
- **Local file (experimental)** — Saves the sync file to a folder on your machine (desktop or Android). Labeled **experimental** because behavior can depend on how you use that folder (e.g. multiple app instances at once). For many users it works fine. It is **not** being removed.

## When to use which

- **You want the newest sync stack and can accept beta** → **SuperSync** (self-hosted or hosted). Good if you want real-time sync and optional E2E encryption on the server.
- **You want cloud sync without running a server** → **Dropbox**. Stable and well supported.
- **You already use Nextcloud (or another WebDAV server)** → **WebDAV**. Try it; if it works with your server, you’re set. If not, the experimental label reflects that WebDAV compatibility varies.
- **You want backup or sync to a local/network folder (desktop or Android only)** → **Local file**. No account, no internet. Use for one device or backup to an external drive/NAS. **Do not** use tools like Syncthing or Resilio to sync that same folder between devices—they can cause conflicts. For multi-device sync, use WebDAV, Dropbox, or SuperSync instead.

## Important: Local file and Syncthing/Resilio

Local file sync stores data in **one folder** on your device. The app warns: do **not** use file-syncing tools (e.g. Syncthing, Resilio) to sync **that folder** between devices—they can cause conflicts. For syncing between multiple devices, use WebDAV, Dropbox, or SuperSync.
