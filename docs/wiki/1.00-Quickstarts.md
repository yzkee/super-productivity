## Getting Started

### [[1.01-First-Steps]]

_Super Productivity 101_: one quickstart that teaches the web app quick tour (tasks, time tracking, settings, finish day), download and install for desktop/mobile, and additional resources. Ends with links to [[1.02-Configure-Data-Synchronization]], backups, reference, and other quickstarts.

### [[1.02-Configure-Data-Synchronization]]

A linear quickstart to **set up and configure a sync integration**: choose a provider (SuperSync, Dropbox, WebDAV, or Local file), open Settings, enter configuration, verify sync works, and keep backups in mind. Connects to [[2.08-Choose-Sync-Backend]], [[2.09-Configure-Sync-Backend]], [[2.02-Restore-Data-From-Backup]], [[3.08-Sync-Integration-Comparison]], [[4.23-Managing-Your-Data]], and [[3.06-User-Data]].
