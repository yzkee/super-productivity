Due to certification issues it's recommended to download the app from the Microsoft Store:

<a href='//www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nhfvg8361tw?cid=storebadge&ocid=badge'><img src='https://developer.microsoft.com/store/badges/images/English_get-it-from-MS.png' alt='English badge' width="127" height="52"/></a>

You can also install the app using [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/super-productivity):

```powershell
choco install super-productivity
```
