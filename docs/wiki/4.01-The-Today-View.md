# The Today View

The Today View is the main place you work each day. It shows only tasks that are due today, so you can focus on what matters right now.

## What It Shows

Tasks appear in the Today View when they are **scheduled for today**—that is, their due date is the current day. The app uses the current date and updates the list when the date changes (for example, at midnight). Tasks you schedule for later in the day may stay off the list until their scheduled time.

The **order** of tasks in the Today View is the order you set. When you rearrange tasks there (for example by drag-and-drop or keyboard shortcuts), that order is saved and used whenever you open the Today view.

## How It Differs From Projects and Tags

The Today View is a **time-based** view. Other work views are **category-based**:

| Aspect | Today View | Projects and Tags |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **Which tasks appear** | Tasks due today | Tasks in that project or with that tag |
| **Order** | The order you set in the Today View | The order you set in that project or tag |
| **Updates** | The list updates when the date changes or when you change due dates | You add or remove tasks by changing project or tag |

You do not "add" or "remove" tasks from the Today View by tagging. Scheduling a task for today (or changing its due date to today) puts it in the Today View; changing the due date to another day removes it.

## Planner and the Today View

When you move a task to today (for example via "Move to Today" or by setting its due date to today), it is removed from any planner day it was on. The Today View and the [[4.03-Planner-View]] both represent when work happens—today vs. future days—so a task is either on today's list or on a planner day, not both.
