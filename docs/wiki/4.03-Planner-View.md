# Planner View

The **Planner** view helps you organize tasks across multiple days. Unlike views focused on doing work (like the Today View or project views), the Planner looks ahead so you can arrange tasks across future days, see how work is distributed over time, and integrate calendar events and recurring tasks.

## What the Planner Shows

The Planner displays a rolling window of future days (typically about 15 days, based on your weekday settings). For each day, you see:

- **Tasks planned for that day** — Tasks you've assigned to that date
- **Time estimates** — Total estimated time for all tasks, events, and recurring items on that day
- **Progress percentage** — How much of your available work time is planned (if you've set work start/end times)
- **Calendar events** — Events from external calendars you've connected
- **Recurring task projections** — Instances of repeating tasks that will appear on that day

## Planning Vs Scheduling

The Planner uses **day-level planning**:

- Sets a task's due date (which day it's planned for)
- Does not set a specific time
- For today: the task appears in the Today View and uses today's ordering
- For future days: the task appears in that day's column in the Planner

**Scheduling** (time-specific) is different:

- Sets both a date and a specific time
- Tasks with a specific time are removed from the Planner (they belong in the Schedule view instead)
- Creates entries in the Schedule view with start and end times

So you can plan a task for "Wednesday" in the Planner, or schedule it for "Wednesday at 2 PM" in the Schedule.

## Planned but Not Completed

When you plan a task for a day but don't complete it:

- **For today** — The task stays in the Today View's ordering and appears in both the Today view and the Planner's today column
- **For future days** — The task remains in that day's column in the Planner
- **Automatic cleanup** — Days that have passed are automatically removed from the Planner
- **Deleted tasks** — Tasks you delete are automatically removed from planner days

## Recurring Tasks and Calendar Events

The Planner shows:

- **Recurring task projections** — Instances of repeating tasks on the days they'll occur
- **Recurring tasks without times** — Shown as separate items in each day's column
- **Recurring tasks with times** — Appear in the scheduled items timeline (Schedule view)
- **Calendar events** — External calendar events merged into the same timeline view

## How It Differs From Other Views

| Aspect               | Planner View                        | Today View / Project Views             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Organization**     | By date (day columns)               | By project, tag, or today's list       |
| **Time specificity** | Day-level only (no specific times)  | Can have specific times via scheduling |
| **Focus**            | Forward-looking planning            | Current work and execution             |
| **Recurring tasks**  | Shown as projections on future days | Handled by repeat configuration        |
