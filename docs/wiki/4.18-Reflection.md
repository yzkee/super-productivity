# Reflection

Reflection in Super Productivity is a **freeform text entry** you write for a given day as part of reviewing or wrapping up. It is stored as part of that day’s **metric** (evaluation) data: the app keeps your reflection text and when you created or last updated it, and shows it in the evaluation sheet so you can look back and see what you noted. Understanding what data reflection uses, how it is stored and scoped, and where it appears in the app helps you use it as part of a daily review habit.

Reflection is part of the “completing your day” flow: it lives alongside other daily metrics and is available when you open the evaluation sheet for that day. Evaluation and metrics settings are in [[3.02-Settings-and-Preferences]].

## What Data Supports Daily Reflection?

Daily reflection uses **only what you type**: a freeform text field and a **creation (or update) timestamp**. The app does not auto-fill the reflection from tasks, time tracked, or other metrics. It is **your** note for the day—thoughts, lessons learned, or anything you want to record. The timestamp records when that reflection was added or edited, so you can see how it fits with when you did your review.

## Is Reflection Stored Explicitly or Derived?

Reflection is **stored explicitly**. The app saves your text and timestamp as part of the day’s metric record. It is **not** computed or derived from other data (e.g. task titles, time logs, or productivity scores). If you don’t write a reflection, there is no reflection for that day; if you do, exactly what you entered is what is stored and shown later.

## How Is Reflection Scoped?

Reflection is **scoped per day**. Each day has its own metric record (identified by the date), and the reflection belongs to that day. When you open the evaluation sheet for a given date, you see and edit the reflection for that date. You can write a reflection for today, or open a past day and add or edit one there. There is **one reflection per day** in normal use—the app shows and edits the first (and typically only) reflection entry for that day’s record. The data is **local to your app instance**: it is stored on the device or in your synced data (e.g. WebDAV or Dropbox if you use sync), not in a separate per-user account in the cloud. Whoever uses that app instance sees that instance’s reflections.

## Where Reflection Appears and How It’s Used

- **Evaluation sheet** — Reflection is shown and edited in the evaluation (metrics) view for the chosen day. You open the sheet, see or type your reflection, and the app persists it when you save.
- **Startup banner** — If you have written a reflection for **today** and the app is configured to show it, a startup banner can remind you or surface that reflection when you open the app. That helps tie reflection to “today’s” review without opening the full evaluation sheet.

So reflection is both a **place to write** (in the evaluation sheet) and, when present for today, something the app can **surface** at startup.

## Summary

- **Data**: Freeform text plus a creation/update timestamp; no automatic data from tasks or other metrics.
- **Storage**: Explicit—saved as part of the day’s metric record, not derived.
- **Scope**: Per day (one reflection per day in practice); data is local to the app instance (and any sync you use).
- **Where**: Evaluation sheet for that day; optionally a startup banner when today has a reflection.
