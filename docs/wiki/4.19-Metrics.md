# Metrics

Metrics in Super Productivity are **per-day and context-based data** used to review how you worked: raw inputs you enter or that the app records (e.g. focus sessions, impact rating, energy check-in, reflections), and **derived** values computed from that data (e.g. productivity and sustainability scores, aggregates over a date range, trend indicators). The app **persists** the raw daily fields and **computes** scores, aggregates, and charts on demand so you can see both “what happened that day” and “how that compares over time.” Understanding what is stored vs computed, what each metric represents, and where metrics appear in the app helps you use the evaluation sheet, metrics view, and sharing effectively.

Reflections are one of the persisted daily fields; see [[4.18-Reflection]]. Focus sessions feed into both persisted data and the productivity/sustainability scores; see [[4.15-Timers-and-Focus-Mode]]. Evaluation and metrics settings are in [[3.02-Settings-and-Preferences]].

## What Daily Metrics Are Tracked?

The app tracks **per-day** data in two categories: **persisted** (stored as part of that day’s record) and **computed** (calculated when you open a view or report).

### Persisted Daily Fields

Each day has a **metric record** identified by the date. The app stores:

- **Date** — The day this record belongs to.
- **Focus sessions** — A list of focus-session durations (from Focus Mode) for that day. The app appends a duration when you complete a focus session.
- **Evaluation fields** — Notes, “remind tomorrow,” and **reflections** (freeform text; see [[4.18-Reflection]]). These are what you enter in the evaluation sheet.
- **Impact rating** — Your 1–4 rating of how impactful your work was that day. This is the **main driver** of the productivity score: the app weights impact more than raw time.
- **Energy check-in** — Your 1–3 rating of how you felt (e.g. exhausted / okay / good). This feeds into the **sustainability** score so the app can distinguish “productive but burning out” from “productive and sustainable.”
- **Work and task counters** — Total work minutes (or derived from worklog), completed task count, and planned task count for that day, when the app records them.

So “what the app remembers for a day” is: date, focus sessions, notes/remind/reflections, impact, energy, and work/task totals. Everything else you see (scores, averages, trends, charts) is **computed** from this stored data plus worklog and task data when you open the relevant view.

### Computed on Demand

The app does **not** store these; it calculates them when needed:

- **Aggregate metrics (simple metrics)** — For a chosen **date range** and **context** (see below), the app computes: total time spent, total break time and break count, task counts (completed, total, subtasks, etc.), days worked in the range, and **averages** (e.g. average time per day, average time per task, average breaks per day). These are derived from worklog, break data, and task lists.
- **Productivity score** — A 0–100 style score for a day (or averaged over a period) from: **impact rating** (primary weight), **focused minutes** (from focus sessions), and **total work minutes**. So the score reflects “how valuable was the work?” more than “how many hours?”
- **Sustainability score** — A score that combines **focused minutes**, **total work minutes**, and your **energy check-in**. It helps separate “productive and sustainable” from “productive but overdoing it.”
- **Trend indicators** — Period-over-period comparison (e.g. this week vs last week): whether productivity or sustainability went up, down, or stayed stable, and by how much.
- **Productivity breakdown** — Per-day items with score, impact, focused minutes, total minutes, and energy for a range of days, used for tables and charts.
- **Chart data** — Line charts of productivity and sustainability scores over time (and other series like focus sessions or simple-counter data). The underlying numbers are computed from the persisted metrics and worklog for the displayed range.

So when you open the **metrics view** or **evaluation sheet**, the app loads the stored daily records and then computes scores, aggregates, and chart series for the range and context you’re looking at.

## Persisted Vs Computed: Why It Matters

- **Persisted** — Stored in your data (and synced if you use sync). You can edit or add it (e.g. impact, energy, reflections); the app only appends focus sessions and updates work/task counters as you work. This is the “source of truth” for that day.
- **Computed** — Not stored as separate numbers. If you change a persisted value (e.g. impact) or add more focus sessions, the next time you open the metrics view or evaluation sheet the scores and trends **recalculate**. So you always see scores and charts that match the current stored data.

That split keeps storage simple (one record per day with a fixed set of fields) while still giving you rich summaries and trends.

## What Parts of the App Use These Metrics?

- **Metrics view** — Shows a **table of aggregate metrics** (time spent, time estimated, tasks done/created, days worked, averages for time per day, time per task, breaks, etc.) for the **current work context**. When your context is **today** (the “all tasks” / today view), the table reflects metrics across all your tasks for the configured range; when your context is a **project**, the table reflects only that project’s tasks and worklog. The same view can show **line charts** of productivity and sustainability scores (and other series) over time.
- **Evaluation sheet** — For a **single day**, shows and edits the persisted fields (notes, reflections, impact, energy, remind tomorrow) and **computes** that day’s **productivity score** and **sustainability score** from focus sessions, work minutes, impact, and energy. So the evaluation sheet is where you both **input** daily data and **see** that day’s scores.
- **Share / summary** — When you use the share or “work summary” feature, the app builds a summary from the **aggregate metrics** (and optionally the current project or today context), so the shared text reflects the same numbers you see in the metrics table for that context and range.
- **Charts** — Line charts (e.g. productivity and sustainability over the last N days) are drawn from **computed** breakdown and score data; they don’t have a separate stored “chart” object.

So: **persisted data** is edited and viewed in the evaluation sheet (and focus sessions are added automatically); **computed** aggregates, scores, trends, and charts are shown in the metrics view, evaluation sheet, and share summary.

## How Context Affects Metrics

The **aggregate metrics table** (time spent, task counts, averages, etc.) is **context-sensitive**:

- **Today / all tasks** — The app uses **all tasks** and the full worklog to compute totals and averages. So you see “everything” for the selected range.
- **Project** — The app uses only **tasks in the current project** and worklog for that project. So you see project-specific totals and averages.

The **evaluation sheet** and **per-day scores** are always **per day** (one date at a time). Productivity and sustainability **trends** and **charts** are computed over a **date range** (e.g. last 7 or 30 days) from the stored daily records and worklog; they are not restricted by project—they use the global daily metric records and worklog.

## Summary

- **Persisted per day:** date, focus sessions, notes, remind tomorrow, reflections, impact (1–4), energy (1–3), total work minutes, completed/planned task counts.
- **Computed on demand:** aggregate metrics (time spent, breaks, task counts, averages over a range), productivity score, sustainability score, trend indicators, productivity breakdown, and chart data.
- **Productivity score** emphasizes **impact**; **sustainability score** uses focus time, total work, and **energy check-in**.
- **Where you see them:** evaluation sheet (per-day inputs and scores), metrics view (aggregate table + charts, by context), share summary (aggregates for current context).
