# Wiki QA and Maintenance

As described in the [[0.01-Style-Guide]], `pymarkdownlnt` is used in CI. In the future I would like to integrate link checking (internal and external) as part of the PR process. In addition, an external-only link checking job would be run on a schedule to check for broken links.

A program like [doc-link-checker-cli](https://github.com/djmattyg007/doc-link-checker-cli) could be used to check for broken internal links either interactively or as part of CI during a PR. It supports GitHub-Flavored Markdown: `doc-link-checker lint --md-type gfm`.

Periodically, a CI job could check external links on the wiki, main website, or "awesome repo" with one of the following tools:

- [linkinator](https://jbeckwith.com/projects/linkinator)
- [broken-links (rust)](https://lib.rs/crates/broken-links)
- [broken-links (python)](https://pypi.org/project/broken-links)
- [linkchecker](https://linkchecker.github.io/linkchecker/index.html)
- [checklink](https://dev.w3.org/perl/modules/W3C/LinkChecker/docs/checklink)
