# Quickstart: Set Up and Configure a Sync Integration

This quickstart walks you through choosing a sync provider and configuring it so your Super Productivity data is backed up or synced across devices. By the end you will have sync enabled and know how to confirm it is working and how to stay safe with backups.

**Learning goal:** Enable sync, pick a provider, complete its configuration, and verify sync works.

For the big picture (what your data includes, how sync and backups fit in), see [[4.23-Managing-Your-Data]]. For a detailed comparison of providers, see [[3.08-Sync-Integration-Comparison]].

## Before You Start

- **Single device:** Sync is optional. You can use it to back up data to the cloud or a local folder. Make sure you know how to [[2.02-Restore-Data-From-Backup]] in case you need to restore later.
- **Multiple devices:** You need **one** sync provider. Each device can use a different provider, but typically you choose one (e.g. Dropbox or WebDAV) and use it on all devices so data stays in sync.

## Step 1: Choose a Sync Provider

The app supports four options. Pick the one that matches how you work:

| If you want…                                                     | Choose               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Real-time sync and can accept beta software                      | **SuperSync (Beta)** |
| Cloud sync without running your own server                       | **Dropbox**          |
| To use your existing Nextcloud or other WebDAV server            | **WebDAV**           |
| Backup or sync to a folder on this device (desktop/Android only) | **Local file**       |

**Do not** use file-syncing tools (e.g. Syncthing, Resilio) to sync the **Local file** folder between devices—that can cause conflicts. For multi-device sync, use WebDAV, Dropbox, or SuperSync instead.

Full guidance on when to use which: [[2.08-Choose-Sync-Backend]]. Comparison table and details: [[3.08-Sync-Integration-Comparison]].

**Outcome:** You know which provider you will set up.

## Step 2: Open Sync Settings

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon).
2. Open the **Sync & Backup** tab.
3. In the **Sync** section, turn **Enable syncing** on.
4. Choose your **Sync provider** from the dropdown.

The form will show the fields needed for your chosen provider. Exact fields and options are in [[2.09-Configure-Sync-Backend]].

**Outcome:** Sync is enabled and the correct configuration form is visible.

---

## Step 3: Enter Your provider’s Details

Complete the form for your provider. What you need in practice:

- **SuperSync:** Get an access token from the server (e.g. **Open Server & Get Token** in the app), then paste it. Optionally set a custom server URL or enable encryption under **Advanced**.
- **Dropbox:** Sign in via the app’s link; no password is stored in the app. You can set **Sync interval** and **Only sync manually**, and optionally enable encryption under **Advanced**.
- **WebDAV:** Enter **Base URL** (e.g. your Nextcloud WebDAV URL), **Username**, and **Password**. Set **Sync Folder Path** if needed. Sync interval and manual-only apply; encryption is under **Advanced**.
- **Local file:** Choose the **Sync folder path** with the folder picker (desktop or Android). Sync interval and manual-only apply; encryption is under **Advanced**.

If you enable **encryption** (SuperSync or file-based), use the same password or key on every device that will sync this data. Losing the key means the data cannot be decrypted.

**Outcome:** Configuration is saved. The app will sync automatically at the set interval (or only when you trigger sync if “Only sync manually” is on).

---

## Step 4: Confirm Sync is Working

- **Automatic sync:** Wait for the next sync, or trigger a sync from the UI if available. Check for success in the sync status or notifications.
- **Second device:** On the other device, enable the same provider and sign in or point to the same account/folder. After the first sync, data should match (or you may be prompted to choose “use local” or “use remote” if both sides had data).
- **Backup-only (e.g. Local file):** Open the sync folder and confirm the sync file is present and updated after a sync.

If something fails, check the provider’s requirements (e.g. WebDAV URL format, CORS for web app) in [[2.09-Configure-Sync-Backend]] and [[3.08-Sync-Integration-Comparison]].

**Outcome:** You have verified that sync runs and, if applicable, that data appears on the remote side or another device.

---

## Step 5: Keep Backups and Restore in Mind

Sync is not a substitute for knowing how to restore. Ensure automatic backups are enabled if available on your platform, and that you know how to [[2.02-Restore-Data-From-Backup]] from a backup file. Where backups and sync data live: [[3.06-User-Data]] and [[4.23-Managing-Your-Data]].

**Outcome:** You are set up for sync and for recovery if needed.

## Where to Go next

- **Change provider or options:** [[2.09-Configure-Sync-Backend]] (all fields, encryption, interval).
- **Compare providers again:** [[3.08-Sync-Integration-Comparison]].
- **How sync and conflicts work:** [[4.23-Managing-Your-Data]] (local-first, conflict resolution).
- **Where data is stored:** [[3.06-User-Data]].
