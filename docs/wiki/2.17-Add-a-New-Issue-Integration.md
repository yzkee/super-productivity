# Add a New Issue Integration

How to add a new issue tracker (e.g. Jira, GitHub, GitLab-style) to Super Productivity.

New integrations implement the shared **IssueProvider** pattern: models, API service, and a common-interfaces service that implements `IssueServiceInterface`. The integration is then registered in core issue model and config.

## High-level Steps

1. Create a directory under `src/app/features/issue/providers/` (e.g. `my-provider/`).
2. Add model files (config and issue types), API service, and a common-interfaces service implementing `IssueServiceInterface`.
3. Add constants and config form section; implement required interface methods (e.g. `isEnabled`, `testConnection$`, `getById$`, `searchIssues$`, `getFreshDataForIssueTask`).
4. Register the provider in `issue.model.ts` (IssueProviderKey, IssueIntegrationCfg, IssueIntegrationCfgs, IssueProvider), `issue.const.ts` (type constant, ISSUE_PROVIDER_TYPES, DEFAULT_ISSUE_PROVIDER_CFGS, ISSUE_PROVIDER_FORM_CFGS_MAP), and ensure the issue service injects and uses it.
5. Optionally add UI (issue content, header, config) in provider-specific subfolders.
6. Run the app, add the integration in settings, and test connection and issue flow.

## Full Guide

Step-by-step instructions, file templates, and the exact interface methods to implement are in the repository:

Use an existing provider (e.g. GitHub or GitLab under `src/app/features/issue/providers/`) as a reference.
