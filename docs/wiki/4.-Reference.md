### Wayland-Compatibility

If you're experiencing issues running Super Productivity on Wayland (such as rendering problems, VSync errors, or GLib-GObject warnings), you can force the application to use X11 mode by starting it with the `--force-x11` parameter:

```bash
superproductivity --force-x11
```

This will automatically apply compatibility fixes including:

- Forcing the Ozone platform to use X11 instead of Wayland
- Disabling GPU VSync to prevent GetVSyncParametersIfAvailable() errors
- Setting the appropriate environment variables for X11 compatibility

The application will automatically detect Wayland sessions and apply these fixes, but you can use this flag if automatic detection doesn't work properly.
