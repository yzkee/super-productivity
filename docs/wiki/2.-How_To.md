#### Restore Data From Backup

##### Standard Method

The backup path should be shown under settings and then "Automatic Backups". You can then import the backup under "Import / Export".

##### Alternative Method: Pre-Clearing Application

In case the app does not properly start (e.g. [inconsistent task state](https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity/issues/3052)), the data must be cleared first:

1. locate the backup and possibly make another copy of it (not strictly necessary, but can't hurt :))
2. start the app
3. hit strg+shift+i to open the dev tools
4. go to application/storage
5. hit clear site data
6. hit strg+r to reload the app
7. within SP you go to settings and import the previously located backup
