# Manage Subtasks

For how subtasks are modeled and what limits apply (e.g. repeating and issue-linked tasks cannot be subtasks), see [[4.11-Subtasks]].

## Add a Subtask to a Task

**From the context menu:** Right-click the task and click **Add subtask**. (This option appears only for parent tasks that are not done.)

**From the task detail panel:** Open the task (click it so the detail panel opens on the right). At the bottom of the **Subtasks** section, click the **Add subtask** button (plus icon and "Add subtask" label).

**With the keyboard:** Focus the parent task (click it or use the arrow keys), then press **A** (default shortcut for "Add subtask"). See [[3.03-Keyboard-Shortcuts]] to change or confirm the key.

## Reorder Subtasks within a Task

**With the keyboard:** Focus the subtask you want to move. Use:

- **Ctrl+Shift+Arrow Up** — move it up one position in the list
- **Ctrl+Shift+Arrow Down** — move it down one position
- **Ctrl+Alt+Arrow Up** — move it to the top of the subtask list
- **Ctrl+Alt+Arrow Down** — move it to the bottom of the subtask list

Shortcuts are configurable in [[3.02-Settings-and-Preferences]].

**By dragging:** Grab the task by the **drag handle** (the grip icon on the left of the task row) and drag it up or down within the same parent’s subtask list. Drop it where you want the new position.

**Parent task only:** For a top-level (parent) task, you can also right-click it and choose **Move to top** to move it to the top of the main list. There is no "Move to top" menu entry for subtasks; use the keyboard or drag instead.

## Move a Subtask to Another Parent Task

Drag the subtask by its **drag handle** and drop it onto the target parent task, or into that parent’s subtask list. The subtask becomes a child of the new parent and keeps the same project (subtasks inherit the parent’s project).

## Convert a Subtask to a Main Task

Right-click the subtask and click **Convert to parent task**. The subtask becomes a top-level task in the same project. Repeating tasks and issue-linked tasks cannot be converted to subtasks; see [[4.11-Subtasks]].

## Show or Hide Completed Subtasks

On the **parent task row**, next to its subtask list, there is a small **toggle button** (plus/minus icon). Its tooltip is "Toggle subtask visibility." Each click cycles through:

1. **Show all** — all subtasks are visible
2. **Hide done** — completed subtasks are hidden
3. **Hide all** — the subtask list is collapsed

When subtasks are hidden, a line such as "+ 3 done sub tasks" or "+ 5 sub tasks" appears; click it to expand and show subtasks again.

You can also use the **Expand subtasks** and **Collapse subtasks** keyboard shortcuts (see [[3.03-Keyboard-Shortcuts]]) when the parent task is focused.
