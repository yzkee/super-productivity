# Add Tasks

This how-to covers adding new tasks to your list. For subtasks, scheduling, repeating tasks, and issue-linked tasks, see [[2.04-Manage-Subtasks]], [[2.05-Manage-Scheduled-Tasks]], [[2.06-Manage-Repeating-Tasks]], and [[2.07-Manage-Task-Integrations]].

## Open the Add Task bar

**From the header:** Click the **Add new task** button (plus icon) in the top bar. The add task bar opens and the cursor focuses in the input.

**With the keyboard:** Press **Shift+A** (default shortcut for "Add new task"). You can change or confirm the key under [[3.02-Settings-and-Preferences]] → Keyboard; see [[3.03-Keyboard-Shortcuts]].

## Create a Task

1. With the add task bar open, type the task title in the input. The placeholder shows an example: **A task title #tag @16:00** (you can use **#tag** and **@time** or **@date** in the title; see below).
2. Press **Enter** or click the **Add task** button (plus icon next to the input). The task is added to the current project or context (Today / tag).

The new task appears at the **top** or **bottom** of the list depending on the add bar setting (see “Add to top or bottom” below).

## Short Syntax in the Title

While typing the title you can use:

- **#tagName** — Add the task to a tag (e.g. `#work`). If the tag does not exist, you can create it when adding the task.
- **@16:00** or **@09:30** — Set a due time for the task (today by default when only time is given).
- **@tomorrow**, **@next week**, or a date — Set the due date. You can combine with a time (e.g. **@tomorrow @14:00**).

The add task bar also has **Tags**, **Schedule**, and **Estimate** buttons to set these without typing. On the Schedule/Planner view, the add bar may show different options (e.g. “Plan for today”).

## Add to top or Bottom

Next to the input there is a button that toggles whether new tasks go to the **top** or **bottom** of the list. The tooltip shows “Add to top (Ctrl+1)” or “Add to bottom (Ctrl+1)”. You can also press **Ctrl+1** (or the key you configured) to toggle. This applies to the next task you add.

## Add to Backlog or Today (if the Project Has a backlog)

If the current project has **Backlog** enabled, another button appears: **Add to backlog** / **Add to today**. It toggles whether the new task is added to the project’s **backlog** or to **today’s list**. The icon and tooltip (“Add to backlog” vs “Add to today”) show the current mode.

## Add Existing Tasks or Issues (search mode)

Click the **search** icon (or press **Ctrl+2**, if configured) in the add task bar to switch to **issue search** mode. The placeholder changes to “Add existing task or issues…”. You can search for:

- Tasks from the **archive** or other projects — select one to add it to the current context.
- **Issues** from configured integrations (Jira, GitHub, etc.) — select one to add it as a linked task.

Type to search, then choose an item from the list to add it. Disable search again with the search button or **Ctrl+2** to return to normal “create new task” mode.

## Where New Tasks Go

- **Project view:** Tasks are added to the **current project**. With “Add to backlog” on, they go to the project backlog; otherwise they go to the main list (or today, depending on context).
- **Today / tag view:** Tasks are added to the **current tag** (e.g. Today). They also belong to a project; if you are in a project’s Today view, the task is in that project.
- **Schedule / Planner:** When you use the add bar there, you can plan the task for a specific day (e.g. today); the task is scheduled for that day.

## Add a Task from the Schedule / Planner

On the Schedule or daily planning view, you may see an **Add** button (plus icon and “Add” label) for a day. Click it to open the same add task bar in place; the task can be created and planned for that day. Creating the task closes the inline add bar.
