# Issue Integration Comparison

This reference lists which capabilities each **issue provider** supports: issue import, status transitions, time tracking/worklog submission, comments, subtasks, attachments, filtering options, auto-import to backlog, story points, due dates, and other provider-specific behavior. Use it to compare providers or to see what to expect when you enable one.

For an overview of how integrations work and how to set them up, see [[4.24-Integrations]] and [[2.07-Manage-Task-Integrations]]. For a comparison of **sync** providers (WebDAV, Dropbox, SuperSync, local file), see [[3.08-Sync-Integration-Comparison]].

## Core Capabilities (All Providers)

Every issue provider supports the same basic operations: checking that the integration is enabled, testing the connection, opening the issue in the external system, fetching an issue by ID, searching issues, and adding an issue as a task in the app. All providers also support refreshing already-imported tasks so that changes in the external system (title, status, etc.) are reflected locally. Each provider has a configurable **poll interval** (or none) for how often the app checks for updates. Beyond that, support for status transitions, worklogs, comments, subtasks, attachments, and filtering depends on the provider and the external API.

## Implementation Notes

- **Broadest feature set:** Jira and OpenProject support the most capabilities: configurable status transitions, worklog submission, and advanced filtering. OpenProject adds progress percentage and activity; Jira adds JQL, subtasks, and assignment handling.
- **Comment-focused:** GitHub and GitLab offer solid issue import and comment tracking (with optional username filtering) but do not support worklog submission; GitLab worklog support is deprecated.
- **Subtask support:** Besides Jira, only ClickUp supports full subtask import and relationship tracking among the listed providers.
- **Calendar-oriented:** CalDAV and Calendar (iCal) are geared toward calendar/todo and event integration (categories, event duration, today's events) rather than full issue-tracking features.
- **Auto-import and polling:** Most providers support automatic polling for updates and many support auto-import of new issues into the backlog; exact behavior (e.g. "last 100" vs custom query) is provider-specific.

Optional capabilities (e.g. subtasks, attachments, sending updates back to the external system) are implemented per provider depending on what the external API supports.
