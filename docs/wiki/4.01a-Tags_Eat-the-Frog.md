# Tags: Eat the Frog

To make it easier for yourself to work on tasks that actually are the most important (and sometimes the most daunting) there is a concept referred to as "eating the frog".

The idea is to plan actionable tasks for your projects and make sure to assign a tag (A, B, C, or D) to each task. Each letter stands for a different category of urgency to act:

A: Tasks, when they are not done, will have serious and fairly immediate consequences for the project.

B: Tasks that are important, but if not done right away, do not have immediate serious consequences.

C: Tasks that would be nice to do, but can wait.

D: Tasks where you are waiting for input from other people, or tasks that should be delegated as soon as possible because the action required is not up to you.

It's a good idea to go through the plan every few days and revise the tasks and their priorities. Then, each morning or the night before, it is just a matter of going through the 'A' tag and identifying the tasks for the day.
