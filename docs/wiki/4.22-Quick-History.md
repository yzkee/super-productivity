# Quick History

Quick History is a **week-centric view** of the time you have logged on tasks, limited to the **current year**. It uses the same underlying data as the [[4.21-Worklog]]—your tasks’ “time spent per day” from both active and archived tasks—but presents it as a compact list of **weeks**, each with a total time and expandable **days** that show per-task entries. Unlike the worklog screen, Quick History lets you **edit** the time spent for a task on a given day directly in the view. It is scoped to the same **work context** (project or tag) as the worklog and is meant for fast review and correction of recent time without opening the full, multi-year worklog.

For how time is recorded and where “time spent per day” comes from, see [[4.14-How-Time-Is-Logged]]. For the full worklog (all years, read-only, export), see [[4.21-Worklog]].

## Quick History Vs Worklog

| Aspect | Quick History | Worklog |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| **Time range** | Current year only | All years (full archive) |
| **Structure** | Weeks → days → task entries | Years → months → days (or years → weeks → days) → entries |
| **Purpose** | Compact, recent summary with inline time editing | Detailed, day-by-day log for review and export |
| **Editing** | Yes — you can change time spent per task per day inline | No — read-only view and export |
| **Scope** | Same as worklog: active work context (project or tag) | Same: active work context |
| **Access** | Work-context menu (e.g. project or tag) → Quick History | Work-context menu → Worklog |

Both views are **generated** from the same source: active and archived tasks for the current context, with their “time spent per day” data. Navigating to either screen triggers a refresh of that data. So Quick History is a **focused slice** of the same information the worklog uses—current year, by week—plus the ability to correct time inline.

## What Quick History Shows

- **Weeks** — One row per week of the current year, with the **week number** and **total time spent** that week. Weeks are usually ordered with the **most recent first**.
- **Days** — Each week can be expanded to show **days** that have logged time. For each day you see:
  - **Total time** spent that day
  - **Number of log entries** (tasks with time on that day)
  - **Work start/end** times for that day, if configured
  - **Simple counters** (e.g. stopwatch or click counters) for that day, if you use them
- **Task list per day** — Expanding a day shows a **per-task table**: task title, and for each task the time spent on that day. Only tasks that are **done** or have **more than a second** of time are shown, so the list stays relevant. For **leaf tasks** (no subtasks), the time is **editable inline**—you can change the duration for that task on that day. For parent tasks, the table shows the **sum** of subtask time (read-only in this view).

So you get a quick answer to “what did I do this week?” and “what did I log on this day?” with the option to fix time without opening the task or the full worklog.

## How Far Back It Looks

Quick History includes **only the current year**. If there is no logged time for the current year in the selected work context, the view shows a message such as “No data for current year.” For older data (previous years), use the **Worklog** view, which includes all years.

## Data Source and Refresh

- **Source** — Same as the worklog: **active tasks** and **archived tasks** for the current project or tag, with their “time spent per day” and optional work start/end and simple-counter data. The app builds a **week-based** structure (year → week → day) from that data.
- **Refresh** — Like the worklog, Quick History is refreshed when you **navigate** to the Quick History screen (or when the shared worklog refresh runs). It does not update in real time as you track; open the view or refresh to see the latest data.
- **Scope** — You open Quick History from a **project** or a **tag** (work-context menu). The data you see is for that project or tag only.

## Inline Editing and Persistence

When you **edit** time for a task on a day in Quick History, the app updates that task’s “time spent per day” for that date. The change is persisted the same way as other time changes (e.g. after tracking or idle reassignment), so the updated value appears in the worklog, reports, and metrics. Inline editing is only for **leaf tasks**; parent tasks show the sum of subtask time and are not edited here.

## Where to Find It

Quick History is available from the **work-context menu** (the menu for the current project or tag), alongside **Worklog** and **Metrics**. You can open it for a project or for a tag; the route reflects the context (e.g. project/:id/quick-history or tag/:id/quick-history).

## Summary

- **Quick History** = week-centric view of **time spent per day** for the **current year**, scoped to the active project or tag.
- **Same data as Worklog** — Built from active + archived tasks; different layout (weeks first, current year only) and **inline editing** of time per task per day.
- **Worklog** = all years, read-only, detailed day-by-day, with export; **Quick History** = current year, week-by-week, with inline time editing.
- **Refresh** on navigation; **scope** = current work context (project or tag).
