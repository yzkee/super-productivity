# First Steps

Welcome!

This series of notes will get you up and running right away so you can see if Super Productivity works for you.

First, walk through the most basic tasks in the Web-version of the App in [[1.01a-First-Steps_Quick-Tour]].

What is covered:

- adding tasks
- editing tasks
- deleting tasks
- using the time tracker
- Sync settings and their importance

If you are ready to move up to the Desktop version take a look at [[1.01b-First-Steps_Download-and-Install]].

With the basics sorted out you will likely want to start doing _more_. [[1.01c-First-Steps_Additional-Resources]] will help direct you to solve specific problems or answer questions.
