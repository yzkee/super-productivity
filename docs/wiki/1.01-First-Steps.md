# First Steps

Welcome! This quickstart gets you up and running with Super Productivity: you will try the web app, add and manage tasks, use the time tracker, then see how to install the desktop or mobile app and where to go next (sync, backups, and other resources).

## Part 1: Quick Tour (web app)

Open the [Web App](https://app.super-productivity.com/). It doesn't include every desktop feature but is enough to get started. An interactive tour will greet you at first; these notes follow it closely.

**Add a task:** Use the "+" button in the top right or `Shift+A`. Add as many tasks as you like. Short-hand syntax is available (similar to many other task managers). Press Escape or click outside the task overlay when done.

**Time tracking:** Super Productivity integrates time tracking as a core feature. You can remove or add time usage later. Start and stop the timer from anywhere in the app.

**Task details:** Open the side panel on any task to edit its details.

**Delete a task:** Right-click the task and use "Delete Task" at the bottom, or select the task and press Backspace.

Continue the in-app tour to see Projects and Issues. Open **Settings**.

The web app is limited to your browser on one computer at first. If Super Productivity works for you, you will likely want to configure **Sync** so your data is saved reliably—even on a single computer. We can skip Sync for now and set it up later (see [[1.02-Configure-Data-Synchronization]]).

**Finish day:** On the main Today view there is a "Finish Day" button. It moves completed tasks to the archive and shows an end-of-day report: time tracked vs estimates, then subjective ratings (how you felt while working).

That's the basics. Super Productivity supports many working styles; focus on adding tasks and using the time tracker for now. You can explore more options when you're ready.

## Part 2: Download and Install

When you are ready to use the desktop or mobile app, install it for your platform:

[[2.01-Downloads and Install]]

That page covers all platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android), including Snap, Flatpak, AUR, AppImage, and store links. You can also keep using only the web app if you prefer.
