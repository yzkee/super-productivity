# Restore Data From Backup

To understand what a backup contains and how import replaces your data, see [[4.23-Managing-Your-Data]] and [[3.06-User-Data]].

## Standard method: restore via Import/Export

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon in the sidebar or top bar).
2. Open the **Sync & Backup** tab.
3. In the **Automatic Backups** section, the backup location is shown on **desktop** (Electron): a line “Backups are saved to:” followed by the path. Note or copy this path so you can locate a backup file if needed.
4. In the same tab, use the **Import/Export** section. Click **Import from File** and choose your backup file (e.g. from the automatic backup folder). Confirm when warned—import **replaces all current data** and cannot be undone.

If the app finds no data but detects backups (e.g. on startup), it may prompt you to restore the latest backup; you can accept that instead of using Import from File.

## Alternative method: clear app data first, then import

If the app does not start properly (e.g. [inconsistent task state](https://github.com/super-productivity/super-productivity/issues/3052)), clear local data and then import a backup:

1. Locate your backup file (and optionally make a copy).
2. Start the app.
3. Open developer tools: **Ctrl+Shift+I** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+Option+I** (macOS).
4. Open the **Application** tab, then **Storage** in the left sidebar.
5. Click **Clear site data**.
6. Reload the app: **Ctrl+R** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+R** (macOS).
7. In Super Productivity, go to **Settings → Sync & Backup → Import/Export** and use **Import from File** to select your backup.
