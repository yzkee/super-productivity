# Integrations

Super Productivity offers two main kinds of integrations: **Issue Providers** (for bringing in tasks from external project management or issue-tracking systems) and **Sync Providers** (for backing up and synchronizing your data across devices). Both are optional. Understanding what each type does, which providers exist, and how they fit into your workflow helps you decide whether and how to use them.

For step-by-step setup and daily use of issue integrations, see [[2.07-Manage-Task-Integrations]]. For a detailed comparison of issue provider capabilities, see [[3.07-Issue-Integration-Comparison]]; for sync providers, see [[3.08-Sync-Integration-Comparison]]. For where your data is stored, how sync and backups work, and technical details, see [[3.06-User-Data]] and [[4.23-Managing-Your-Data]].

## Two Categories of Integrations

### Issue Providers

**Issue providers** connect the app to external systems (Jira, GitHub, GitLab, and others) so you can:

- Search for issues (bugs, stories, tickets) in those systems.
- Add them as tasks in Super Productivity with one click.
- Keep task titles, status, and other details in sync with the external system.
- Optionally send time logs or status updates back (when the provider supports it).

Each issue provider has its own configuration (URLs, API tokens, filters). You can enable multiple providers and assign them to different projects. Tasks created from issues carry **issue integration attributes** (issue ID, provider, link to the external item); see [[4.09-Task-Attributes]].

### Sync Providers

**Sync providers** handle **data synchronization** between devices (or between the app and a backup location). They do not import issues; they sync your existing Super Productivity data (tasks, projects, time tracking, settings, and so on). Supported options include:

- **WebDAV** — Works with Nextcloud, ownCloud, and other WebDAV-compatible servers.
- **Dropbox** — Uses OAuth so you can store your sync file in Dropbox.
- **SuperSync** — A dedicated sync server that can optionally use end-to-end encryption. SuperSync is very new and is still in beta.
- **Local file sync** — Desktop only; syncs to a local or network folder.

Sync is local-first and operation-based: your device holds the primary copy, and changes are sent as operations to the remote side. For a comparison of sync providers (platform, auth, encryption), see [[3.08-Sync-Integration-Comparison]]. For conflict handling and backup behavior, see [[4.23-Managing-Your-Data]] and [[3.06-User-Data]].

## Available Issue Providers

The app supports **11 issue-style integrations** (the exact list may vary by version): **Jira**, **GitHub**, **GitLab**, **Gitea**, **OpenProject**, **CalDAV**, **Calendar (iCal)**, **Redmine**, **Trello**, **Linear**, and **ClickUp**. Each has a display name and icon in the Issue Panel. Configuration is per-provider and often per-project (e.g. which project new issues are added to).

**Capabilities vary by provider.** Some support full two-way sync (e.g. status transitions and worklog submission); others are mainly for importing and refreshing issues. For a comparison of what each issue provider supports—issue import, status transitions, worklogs, comments, subtasks, attachments, filtering, auto-import, story points, due dates—see [[3.07-Issue-Integration-Comparison]]. For a comparison of sync providers (WebDAV, Dropbox, SuperSync, local file), see [[3.08-Sync-Integration-Comparison]]. In short: Jira and OpenProject offer the widest set (worklogs, status workflows, story points); GitHub and GitLab offer issue import and comments; CalDAV and Calendar (iCal) focus on calendar/todo and events; ClickUp supports subtasks alongside Jira.

### iCal Vs CalDAV

**Calendar (iCal)** and **CalDAV** are both calendar-related but **use different protocols and data**:

**Calendar (iCal)** — Uses a **subscription URL** to fetch an **iCal feed** (e.g. `.ics`). The app parses **VEVENT** components only (events with start/end time). Events appear in the Schedule/Planner; the event description becomes the task note.
- **No login** is required: you only paste the calendar URL (e.g. a “subscription” or “export” link).
- The app does **not** sync completion or changes back to the server; if you change the event in the app, the external calendar is not updated.
- In **Nextcloud**, use the **“Copy subscription link”** (or equivalent) so the URL is in the form expected for iCal (e.g. `https://<NC-URL>/remote.php/dav/public-calendars/<CALENDAR-ID>?export`). Do **not** use the “Copy private link” here—that format is for CalDAV.

**CalDAV** — Connects to a **CalDAV server** (e.g. Nextcloud calendars) with **username and password**.
- The app requests **VTODO** components only (tasks/todos). It does **not** use VEVENTs.
- You get task import and **completion status can sync back** to the server.
- In **Nextcloud**, use the **“Copy private link”** (or the CalDAV URL for your user/calendar), e.g. `https://<NC-URL>/remote.php/dav/calendars/<USER>/<CALENDAR_NAME>/`. Do **not** use the subscription/export link here—that is for the iCal integration.

## How You Use Integrations in Practice

### Setup

1. Open the **Issue Panel** (right side on desktop, bottom on mobile) and use the "+" tab to see available issue providers.
2. Add and configure a provider: enter URLs, API tokens, and any filters (e.g. JQL, assignee) in the form for that provider.
3. Optionally set a default project so new issues are added to the right project, and reorder provider tabs by drag-and-drop if you use several.

Sync is configured separately (e.g. in settings) by choosing a sync provider and connecting your account or path.

### Daily Workflow

1. **Search and add** — In the Issue Panel, search within a provider and add issues as tasks with one click.
2. **Polling** — The app can poll in two ways:
   - **Poll for changes** — Update already-imported tasks when the external system changes.
   - **Auto-add to backlog** — Periodically import new issues that match your filters into a project backlog.
3. **Task sync** — When an issue changes in the external system, the app can update the linked task and notify you.
4. **Sending data back** — For providers that support it (e.g. Jira, OpenProject), completing a task or logging time can submit worklogs or status updates to the external system.

### Handy Options

- **Pinned searches** — Save frequently used search queries in the Issue Panel for quick access.
- **Default project** — Attach a provider to a project so new issues land in that project by default.
- **Subtasks** — Providers like Jira can import subtasks and keep the hierarchy in the app; see [[4.11-Subtasks]].

## Impact on Users Who Do Not Use Integrations

Integrations are **optional** and designed to have **minimal impact** if you do not use them:

1. **Issue Panel** — The panel is only shown if you open it or add a provider. You can do everything with the main add-task bar and never see issue integrations.
2. **Task creation** — You can create and use "plain" tasks (no issue link) without any provider. The core add-task flow does not depend on integrations.
3. **UI** — The Issue Panel can be toggled off so it does not clutter the interface.
4. **Performance** — When a provider is disabled, no polling or API calls run for it, so there is no background cost for providers you do not use.

If you only use sync (e.g. WebDAV or Dropbox) and no issue providers, you get backup and cross-device sync without any issue-import features.

## Platform and Privacy Notes

- **Web vs desktop** — Some integrations (e.g. Jira, calendar, WebDAV) can be limited in the browser by CORS. The app may recommend the desktop version or the Chrome extension for full functionality. This does not affect users who do not use integrations.
- **Privacy** — Integrations talk directly to your chosen services (Jira, GitHub, your WebDAV server, etc.). The app does not send your data to Super Productivity servers; configuration and synced data stay under your control and in the storage you choose.

## Summary

- **Issue providers** import and sync tasks from external issue/project systems (Jira, GitHub, GitLab, etc.); **sync providers** sync your app data across devices (WebDAV, Dropbox, SuperSync, local file).
- Both are optional; the app works fully without any integration.
- Setup is via the Issue Panel (for issue providers) and sync settings (for sync providers). Daily use: search → add as task → optional polling and two-way updates where supported.
- Users who do not use integrations see no meaningful overhead; the Issue Panel and polling only run when configured.
