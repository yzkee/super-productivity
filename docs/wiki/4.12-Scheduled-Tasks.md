# Scheduled Tasks

Scheduled tasks in Super Productivity are tasks that have a due date, and optionally a specific due time and a reminder. Scheduling lets you place work on a particular day or at a particular moment so it appears in the Today View, the Schedule timeline, and the dedicated scheduled-tasks list. Understanding how scheduling interacts with task status, what happens when a scheduled task is not completed on time, and how scheduled tasks are shown across views helps you plan and work effectively.

For how to set due dates, times, and reminders, see [[2.05-Manage-Scheduled-Tasks]]. For how the Today View and Schedule use scheduled tasks, see [[4.01-The-Today-View]] and [[4.04-Schedule-View]].

## How Scheduling Interacts with Task Status

Scheduling and completion status operate **independently**. When you schedule a task—set a due date, due time, or reminder—the app updates the task’s scheduling data only. It does **not** change whether the task is done or not. You can schedule an incomplete task, complete a task and leave its due date in place, or reschedule a task at any time regardless of its completion status. That separation lets you use scheduling for planning (when you intend to do something) and completion for reality (what you have actually done), without one action overwriting the other.

The **Today View** uses a time-based rule to decide which tasks appear: a task is “for today” if its due date is today or if it has a due time that falls today. The app does **not** use a “today” tag on the task; membership in the today list is derived from the due date (and due time) alone. The order of tasks in the Today View is stored separately so you can rearrange the list; the **membership** (whether a task appears at all) is always computed from the task’s scheduling fields. That keeps a single source of truth: the due date and time drive both the Schedule and the Today list.

## What Happens If a Scheduled Task Is Not Completed on Time

The app does **not** automatically change or remove tasks when they become overdue. A task that was due yesterday remains in the system with that due date; it is still incomplete until you complete it, reschedule it, or delete it. You can use **reminders** (configured per task) to get notified at a chosen time; reminders help you stay aware of upcoming or past-due work but do not alter the task’s due date or completion status.

In the **Today View**, the app focuses on what is actionable **right now**. When you are in the Today context, tasks that are **scheduled for later today** (a due time that is still in the future) can be **filtered out** of the main list so you see only tasks that are due now or earlier today, or tasks without a specific time. That reduces clutter and helps you concentrate on the next thing to do. Tasks scheduled for later today remain scheduled and will appear when their time comes or in other views (for example the Schedule or the scheduled-tasks list); they are only hidden from the Today list until it makes sense to show them. Whether a task stays in the today list when you schedule it for a future **day** (not just later today) is controlled by app behavior: tasks scheduled for today stay in the today list; tasks scheduled for a future date are removed from the today list and appear in the Planner and Schedule for that day instead.

## How Scheduled Tasks Are Shown Across Views

Scheduled tasks surface in several places, each with a different purpose.

### Today View

The **Today View** shows tasks that are due today. A task appears there if its due date is today or if it has a due time that falls today. The order of tasks in the Today View is the order you set (for example by drag-and-drop); that order is saved. Membership—“is this task for today?”—is always determined by the due date and time, not by a tag. So when you schedule a task for today (or change its due date to today), it appears in the Today View; when you change the due date to another day, it leaves the Today View. When the Today list is filtered to focus on immediately actionable items, tasks scheduled for **later today** may be hidden from the list until their time approaches.

### Scheduled List (Tasks with Time)

A dedicated **scheduled list** (or scheduled-tasks page) shows all tasks that have a **specific due time**—not just a due date, but a date and time. This list includes both future and past scheduled tasks, so you can see everything that is or was time-specific in one place. Each task is shown with its date and time (and reminder if set). This view is useful for reviewing what you have scheduled and when, without the timeline layout of the Schedule.

### Schedule View

The **Schedule View** shows tasks on a **timeline** over the upcoming 30 days. Tasks with a due date and time appear as blocks at that time; their duration on the timeline comes from their time estimate (or a default if none is set). Tasks with only a due date (no specific time) appear as flexible work that “flows” around the time-fixed tasks. So the Schedule view is where you see **when** scheduled tasks occur in the day and how they fit with other work. See [[4.04-Schedule-View]] and [[4.08-Time-Estimates]].

### Work Context and “Later Today” Filtering

When your **work context** is the Today View, the app can **filter out** tasks that are scheduled for later today so the list emphasizes what you can do now. Tasks due earlier today, or due today without a specific time, stay in the list; tasks with a due time that is still in the future today are hidden from this list until that time. They are not deleted or rescheduled; they are only hidden in the Today context to reduce noise. In other contexts (for example the Schedule or the scheduled list), those tasks still appear.

## Summary: Scheduling in One Place

- **Scheduling** updates only the task’s due date, due time, and reminder; it does not change completion status.
- **Today membership** is based on due date (and due time) only—no “today” tag; the app computes it.
- **Overdue tasks** are not auto-handled; reminders can alert you, but tasks stay until you complete or reschedule them.
- **Today list** can hide “later today” tasks so you focus on immediately actionable items; scheduled tasks still appear in the Schedule and scheduled list.
- **Tasks scheduled for today** stay in the today list; **tasks scheduled for a future date** leave the today list and appear in the Planner and Schedule for that date.
