# Build for Android

How to build the Android app for Super Productivity.

The Android app is developed in a separate repository and supports **Connectivity-Free Mode** (offline-first) and **Online-Only Mode** (compatibility).

## Where to Find Instructions

Full build and configuration steps are in the Android repo:

**[android/README.md](https://github.com/super-productivity/super-productivity/blob/master/android/README.md)** (in this repository: `android/README.md`)

That README covers:

- Choosing launch mode (Connectivity-Free vs Online-Only)
- Setting `LAUNCH_MODE` in `app_config.properties`
- Step-by-step build guides:
  - [Connectivity-Free Mode](https://github.com/super-productivity/super-productivity/blob/master/android/README_OFFLINE.md) (recommended)
  - [Online-Only Mode](https://github.com/super-productivity/super-productivity/blob/master/android/README_ONLINE.md)
