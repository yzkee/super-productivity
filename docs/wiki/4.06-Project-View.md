# Project View

A **project** is the primary way to organize tasks in Super Productivity. Every task belongs to exactly one project, making projects the main organizational structure for your work.

## What Projects Are

Projects are self-contained workspaces. Each project has:

- **Task lists** — Active tasks and an optional backlog
- **Notes** — Project-specific notes
- **Theme settings** — Custom colors and appearance
- **Integration settings** — Connections to external issue trackers (like Jira or GitHub)

When you switch to a project view, you see only the tasks that belong to that project, along with the project's notes and settings.

## Projects Vs Tags

Projects and tags serve different organizational purposes:

| Aspect | Projects | Tags |
|--------|---------|------|
| **Relationship to tasks** | Each task belongs to exactly **one** project (required) | Each task can have **zero or more** tags (optional) |
| **Purpose** | Primary organizational structure — every task has a home project | Secondary labels for cross-cutting categorization |
| **Features** | Backlog, notes, theme, integrations | Simple labels for filtering and grouping |

A task must always belong to a project. Tags are optional labels you can add to tasks across different projects to create cross-cutting categories.

## Project Features

**Backlog**: Projects can have a separate backlog list for tasks you're not actively working on. You can move tasks between the active list and the backlog.

**Notes**: Each project can have its own notes, separate from task notes.

**Theme**: Projects can have custom colors and appearance settings to help you visually distinguish them.

**Integrations**: Projects can connect to external issue trackers (like Jira, GitHub, GitLab) to sync tasks and track work.

## Organizing Projects

Projects themselves are **flat** — there are no parent projects or subprojects. A project cannot contain other projects.

However, you can **organize projects into folders** in the navigation menu. Folders can be nested (folders within folders) to create a hierarchy for navigation, but this is purely for organization — it doesn't change how projects work or how tasks are stored.

You can move projects between folders without affecting the tasks or any other project data.

## How Tasks Belong to Projects

Every task has a project assignment. When you create a task, it's assigned to the current project (or the Inbox if you're in a tag context without a default project). You can change a task's project by:

- Dragging and dropping the task to another project in the navigation
- Editing the task and selecting a different project

When you view a project, you see all tasks that belong to it. When you view a tag, you see tasks from multiple projects that have that tag, and each task shows its project as a badge.
