# Hardening earns its place

Narrative behind the **Hardening needs an observed instance** rule in
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md). The invariant lives there; the evidence lives here.

## What happened

A privacy branch (#7870, #5314) removed user content — task titles, notes,
calendar event titles — from the app's exportable log history, and disabled
Chromium's spellchecker so the app stops contacting Google for dictionaries.

The privacy fixes ended up spanning 19 files (117 insertions, 45 deletions).
They were _not_ right first time: the first commit covered five files, and
review then found the iCal `SUMMARY` leak, nine more content-bearing sites and
the Jira issue-picker response. Only one of the six files the first commit
touched was still untouched at the end.

Around them grew roughly 700 lines of enforcement machinery: a custom ESLint
rule, a grandfathered exception list, a fail-closed Electron `webPreferences`
assertion, and a source-scanning test. Every round of review found a way past
the rule; every finding was closed by adding another branch; each addition was
individually cheap and jointly unjustifiable. Note the past tense is not
earned: the rule and its spec together are ~627 lines at the time of writing,
larger than the pre-cut peak this paragraph describes.

## What the measurements showed

Seven additions to the rule had **zero instances** anywhere in the codebase.
One (`ChainExpression` unwrapping) was provably dead code: its child node type
can never be reportable, so unwrapping it could not change any verdict.

An earlier version of this section attributed each report to the rule branch
that produced it, and quoted that split as evidence. Two later measurements
disagreed with it and with each other. The number is deliberately not restated
here: coverage attribution measures the rule against itself, and it is the
wrong metric — see below.

## What review found afterwards

The measurement above attributes each report to the rule branch that produced
it. It says nothing about whether a report is a _leak_, and that turned out to
be the number that mattered: roughly half the 121 were scalars the naming
heuristics could not classify (`dateStr`, `evName`, `initialSyncDone`, `date1`,
`providerRaw`, `zoomFactor`). Framing that list as "debt to pay down" would
have sent contributors renaming benign variables.

Two corrections followed. Widening the heuristics for the largest benign
cluster — timestamps, durations and `err*` strings, each with an observed
instance — removed 27 reports. Fixing the sites that were _actually_ leaking
(three `TaskCopy[]` arrays in `data-repair.ts`, a `Project` in
`undo-task-delete.meta-reducer.ts`, a notification event, an issue search
result, the Jira issue-picker response, and the `task-context-menu-inner`
copy of the very block this branch had already fixed in `task.component.ts`)
removed 14 more hits and 9 files. The baseline settled at 80 hits across 40
files.

The general lesson: **a precision number is the only one that justifies an
allowlist.** Coverage attribution measures the rule against itself. Stated
plainly, because it is the honest state of this branch: no precision number was
ever produced, so the 40-file allowlist still rests on the rough sample above.

Two of the three iCal `SUMMARY` sites that exported private calendar event
titles were `CallExpression`s — a shape the rule documents as a known gap, and
so invisible to it. The third passed the title as a bare identifier and the
rule's first version does report it.

## The three failure modes worth remembering

**Findings are hypotheses, not work orders.** "You missed X" was treated as an
instruction to close X, without asking whether X occurs in this repo. Two
regressions came from acting on a reviewer's aside: narrowing a key allowlist
to quantities only (which turned `{ error: errorMessage }`, the canonical safe
idiom, into a CI-failing error), and removing `??`/`||`/`?:` traversal (which
opened a cheaper bypass than the `!` it had just closed). A third suggestion —
dropping `use` from the boolean-name allowlist — was tried, immediately
false-positived on `useAlarmStyle`, and reverted before it was ever committed.

**Automation can launder a defect into recorded debt.** The grandfathered
offender list was regenerated from lint output, so a false positive introduced
by a change was silently _added_ to a list whose stated invariant is that it may
only shrink. A generated allowlist needs a gate: if it grows, stop and justify
each new entry.

**Verify that a check can fail before trusting that it passed.** Two
verification steps were theatre: `npx tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit` is a no-op
here (the root config is solution-style, `"files": []` — use
`src/tsconfig.app.json`, `src/tsconfig.spec.json`,
`electron/tsconfig.electron.json`), and a stale `.eslintcache` returned
identical counts either side of a real change. Negative controls — break the
thing, confirm the test goes red, restore it — caught what assertions did not.

## The cheaper alternative that existed the whole time

Three mechanisms policed one boolean: a per-window `spellcheck: false` flag, a
fail-closed assertion in the `webPreferences` guard, and a test scanning source
for the flag. The assertion could `process.exit(333)` mid-session, because two
of the three windows are built lazily inside an IPC handler and an async
function.

The assertion and the source-scanning test both went away, replaced by one call
at app-ready:

```ts
session.defaultSession.setSpellCheckerEnabled?.(false);
```

The per-window flag stayed. Cutting it too was the overcorrection in the other
direction: the two layers fail differently, so neither subsumes the other. The
session call covers every window on the default session — all of them — and any
window added later, which a per-window flag cannot do. The flag is what still
holds if the session call is skipped or a future window takes its own session,
and it cannot fail silently. It costs one line per window.

`?.` keeps the benign case quiet — Electron builds the session spellchecker
behind `ENABLE_BUILTIN_SPELLCHECKER`, so a distro-packaged rebuild has no method
to call. Anything else reaching the `catch` means the call existed and threw, so
that layer is off; it warns rather than swallowing. It never rethrows: an
exception escaping `emit('ready')` skips every window-creating listener
registered after it and exits 333 — no app at all, over a dictionary fetch.

## Rejected guards

Guards measured against real history and turned down. Recorded so they are not
re-proposed from first principles.

**"Extension surfaces need a dedicated PR" — CI gate, rejected 2026-09.** The
proposal: fail a PR that changes a persisted model, the sync wire or the plugin
API alongside anything else, so those changes always arrive alone. Measured over
the 150 most recent squash-merged PRs on `master` (2026-09, using the surface
paths in [`feature-review-guide.md`](feature-review-guide.md)): **~14 of 150
would have failed, and 0 would have passed.** Not one surface change in that
window was already shaped the way the gate demanded, because these changes
arrive atomically coupled to their consumers — a plugin-API method with no
bridge implementation is a lie to plugin authors, and a model field with no
reader is dead code. Roughly a quarter of the fires were not surface changes at
all (router query params, a UI banner enum, a dead-code deletion).

The premise did not survive either. The regression the gate was meant to prevent
— the v18.15.0 boot-to-empty-store incident behind #9124/#9125 — came from
`3ae2360345` (#8965), a small, focused **10-file** feature PR whose entire
surface change was one required field. Splitting that field into its own PR
would have shipped the identical bug; what fixed the class was
`frozen-state.spec.ts`. PR size was not the signal. A second variant, a
generated API-surface snapshot, was rejected on cost: prototypes produced ~1,300
lines of output in which a single new `Task` field lands on 3 lines and a third
of the file churns when an unrelated union gains a member.

Both variants also shipped with a bypass label designed in from the start, which
is the tell: a check you build an escape hatch for before writing it is one you
already expect to be wrong.
