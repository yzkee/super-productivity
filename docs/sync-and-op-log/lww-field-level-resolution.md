# Design note: LWW resolutions that carry only the fields that must win

**Status:** proposal, 2026-09-30. Nothing here is implemented. @johannesjo
decides (see [Decisions](#decisions-for-johannesjo)). Tracker: #10393, queue
item 1. Findings: #10382.

## Problem

After a conflict, the resolving device uploads a replace-mode `[X] LWW Update`
that carries its whole entity. Receivers replace the entity with it, which
erases a concurrent edit of a field the winner never touched. When the remote
side wins, the local side's edits are dropped instead. The fuzz harness and
E2E reproductions trace these issues to this:

- **#10379** (`whole-entity-lww-drops-fields`): habit counts, note locks, done
  status and tracked time are erased everywhere.
- **#10260** (`remote-win-keeps-local-edit`): the losing device keeps its
  rejected edit, which never uploads.
- **#10385** (unreleased, since #10252): the snapshot is read before the same
  download's commuting ops apply, so it erases them on the other device.
- **Part of the tracked-time loss** (#10378): a delta is rejected together with
  the side that lost.

## How it works today

All of this is in
[`conflict-resolution.service.ts`](../../src/app/op-log/sync/conflict-resolution.service.ts)
unless noted.

1. `autoResolveConflictsLWW` calls `_resolveConflictsWithLWW` first, and that
   builds every resolution op from the store. Only afterwards are the batch's
   non-conflicting remote ops applied, so every store read is pre-batch
   (#10385).
2. `_resolveConflictsWithLWW` plans the winners with sync-core's
   `planLwwConflictResolutions`, which uses the max timestamp and then the
   clientId of that op. It then tries `_tryCreateDisjointMergeOp`, which
   refuses:
   - more than one conflict per entity in the batch;
   - any delete, archive or multi-entity op;
   - a type without a
     [`RECREATE_FALLBACK`](../../src/app/op-log/core/recreate-fallback.const.ts)
     entry (only TASK, PROJECT, TAG and SIMPLE_COUNTER have one);
   - an additive time op (`isAdditiveTimeOp`, #10147);
   - a failed `isDisjointMergeEligible` check
     ([`conflict-disjoint-merge.util.ts`](../../src/app/op-log/sync/conflict-disjoint-merge.util.ts)):
     an opaque op (habit count `setSimpleCounterCounterToday`,
     `planTasksForToday`), a noise-only side, or a field both sides wrote;
   - a whole-entity-win plan, or missing entity state or clientId.
3. A merge emits one `lwwUpdateMode: 'patch'` op whose delta comes only from
   the two sides' ops (`synthesizeMergedChanges`). This is why both resolvers
   build the same bytes. Both originals are rejected; the patch is applied
   locally and uploaded.
4. Otherwise a local win runs `_createLocalWinUpdateOp`:
   - It reads the store and emits a `'replace'` op. SIMPLE_COUNTER goes out as
     `'patch'` with `clearedFields` instead (`asPatchSnapshotIfTypeShadowed`).
   - `buildTimeAwareResolutionBatches`
     ([`fold-sync-time-spent.util.ts`](../../src/app/op-log/sync/fold-sync-time-spent.util.ts))
     folds the batch's non-conflicting and winning remote time ops (deltas,
     rounding, absolute `timeSpentOnDay` edits) into TASK snapshots.
   - The deltas of a remote side that **lost** are rejected, and their time is
     gone.
5. A second producer is `SupersededOperationResolverService`
   ([`superseded-operation-resolver.service.ts`](../../src/app/op-log/sync/superseded-operation-resolver.service.ts)).
   It rebuilds every server-rejected field-update op, merged patches included,
   as a `'replace'` snapshot from the store. It rebases a commuting time delta
   in place instead (`rebasePendingLocalOps`). The pin "done status is lost when both
   devices also rename the task" runs through it.
6. Sync-core's `partitionLwwResolutions`
   ([`conflict-resolution.ts`](../../packages/sync-core/src/conflict-resolution.ts))
   rejects **every local op of every conflict, whoever wins**. A remote win
   applies the remote ops, which are usually partial. A local-only field edit
   therefore stays in local state and never uploads (#10260).
7. `isCommutingTimeDeltaCrossing` treats a time delta that crosses a disjoint
   edit as no conflict. That is how #10385's notes edit bypasses step 1.
8. Receivers apply the op in
   [`lwwUpdateMetaReducer`](../../src/app/root-store/meta/task-shared-meta-reducers/lww-update.meta-reducer.ts):
   - `'replace'` → `setOne`;
   - `'patch'` or any other mode, including none → `updateOne`;
   - an absent entity → `addOne` with the `RECREATE_FALLBACK` backfill. NOTE is
     added raw, and a marked `recreatesEntityAfterDelete` patch is ignored.
   - Tasks keep their project, tag and Today lists in step. Nothing keeps
     `note.todayOrder` in step.
9. The envelope is `LwwUpdatePayload`
   ([`operation.types.ts`](../../packages/sync-core/src/operation.types.ts)).
   Its flat `actionPayload` extracts as `{}`, so the merge sees a resolution op
   as opaque (the no-re-merge contract in
   [conflict-journal-and-review.md](./conflict-journal-and-review.md)).

## Options

### A. Field patch: generalize the disjoint merge to overlapping fields

- **Every update-vs-update resolution becomes a merge:** a `'patch'` that
  holds the union of both sides' fields as read from their ops.
- **A field both sides wrote** takes the value of `plan.winner` (sync-core's
  planner: max timestamp, then the clientId of that op). Today
  `synthesizeMergedChanges` lets the remote value win a shared key, and its
  noise tiebreak uses `localOps[0].clientId`; both must switch to the planner's
  rule so two resolvers agree on equal-timestamp ties.
- **The loser's other fields upload too,** so this covers both directions.

Its pieces:

1. **Allow overlap, and aggregate one entity's conflicts into one side each.**
   Two resolvers with staggered batches must provably build byte-identical
   patches, or equal-timestamp patches tie and diverge (why more than one
   conflict per entity is refused today). A both-devices-resolve test with a
   timestamp tie is required.
2. **Keep time out of the patch** (option C's patch rule).
3. **Route `SupersededOperationResolverService` through the same builder.**
   Otherwise a server-rejected patch comes back as a replace snapshot.

### B. Keep replace, but build the snapshot correctly

- Build the snapshot after the batch applies.
- Overlay the readable fields that only the remote side wrote.
- Fold in the losing remote deltas too.

| Fixes                                                                 | Does not fix                                                        |

| Local-win #10379 cases with readable remote fields, e.g. the done pin | A later resolver's snapshot that never saw the fields: the time pin |
|                                                                       | Staggered-sync divergence of untouched fields                       |

**Cost:** the local-win op is persisted today in one atomic append before the
apply. Building it afterwards needs a second write, and a crash window that
hydration must replay identically.

### C. Time: a delta travels once, as a delta or folded in, never twice

- **A replace snapshot:** carries absolute time with every surviving delta
  folded in, including a losing remote side's deltas, and re-emits nothing.
  Today the losing ones are missing.
- **A patch:**
  - omits the time fields;
  - applies the remote deltas;
  - keeps the local delta out of the rejected set and rebases it in place past
    the resolution clock (`rebasePendingLocalOps`, as
    `SupersededOperationResolverService` already does). Its id, seq and
    payload stay, so it uploads once and replays once.
- **Not a new op.** Restart replay is status-blind
  ([`operation-log-hydrator.service.ts`](../../src/app/op-log/persistence/operation-log-hydrator.service.ts)),
  so a rejected original plus a re-sent copy would add the time twice.
- **Open: a remote win by a replace snapshot.** A released client's winning
  snapshot wipes this device's time while the rebased delta still reaches the
  others. The delta must be re-applied after the winner, or the device
  diverges. The design has no rule for this yet.

| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **#10378** time, local-win direction only | Per-day work start and end times on `TIME_TRACKING` (#10382, low severity) |

### Independent of A and B: admit NOTE

- **Today's merge would fix both note pins** once NOTE has a
  `RECREATE_FALLBACK` entry (lock vs pin, content vs pin): their fields are
  disjoint.
- **A clean regression pin also needs `todayOrder` upkeep** in
  `lwwUpdateMetaReducer`. Otherwise `divergence:.note.todayOrder.*` stays.

## Released clients and graceful degradation

Checked with `git show v18.15.0:` and `git show v19.1.0:`.

- **Both tags:** `'patch'` → `updateOne`, `'replace'` → `setOne`, remote
  `syncTimeSpent` is additive, and unknown envelope keys are dropped.
  v18.15.0 already emits `'patch'` for merges.
- **No new wire key, action type or persisted field, and no schema bump
  (rule 10).**

**The hazards of sending a `'patch'` where a `'replace'` went before:**

1. **Clears.** v18.15.0 ignores `clearedFields`, and v19.1.0 applies it. The
   v18.22.0 boundary is from
   [contributor-sync-model.md](./contributor-sync-model.md) ("Clearing a
   field", #9776), not checked against a tag.
   - An older receiver keeps a stale value, e.g. a cleared `dueWithTime` or
     `reminderId`, where `setOne` cleared it.
   - This is the same documented residual as `asPatchSnapshotIfTypeShadowed`.
2. **Absent entity.** A receiver that applied a concurrent delete recreates
   the entity from the patch:
   - TASK becomes valid but content-less (defaults);
   - NOTE is added raw and invalid, so REPAIR runs (#10380 shape);
   - a replace would have recreated it fully.
   - Under A this widens from today's disjoint merges to every overlapping
     resolution. The resolving device usually cannot know about the delete.

   Recreate snapshots must stay `'replace'`, as `asPatchSnapshotIfTypeShadowed`
   already keeps them.

**The fix only acts where the resolving device runs it.**

- A v19.1.0 device that resolves a conflict still emits a replace snapshot.
- v18.15.0 and v19.1.0 lack the `isAdditiveTimeOp` refusal, so they can still
  merge a delta into a patch (#10147). C puts more standalone deltas on the
  wire at contention time, so this exposure grows on receivers with pending
  edits.
- A mixed fleet in which both devices resolve is unverified, because the
  harness can't run v19.1.0.

**Long-term cost (feature review guide):** persisted model, sync wire and
plugin API are unchanged. A extends the generic merge (rule 12). B adds
ordering machinery to a service grandfathered past the 1200-line cap.

## Fuzz pins and E2E proof

Expected outcomes are by code reading and have not been run. Each fix PR turns
its pins into regression pins and leaves all others unchanged, including those
of #10380 and #10381.

**Start from an E2E** (rule 12: both conflict directions, both timestamp
winners):

- **#10385:** `e2e/tests/sync/supersync-commuting-edit-beside-local-win.spec.ts`
  on `ccr-211e334d-0r60po`. It is `test.fixme`, red 4 of 4 per the issue, and
  queue item 2 ports it.
- **New specs:** #10379's done and time pins (with a restart after the time
  case), a both-devices-resolve case, #10378, and the note pins if NOTE is
  admitted.
- **Must stay green:** `supersync.spec.ts` "3.1" and the `supersync-*` specs
  for `lww-conflict`, `time-delta-rename-crossing`, `time-tracking-advanced`,
  `round-time-conflict`, `simple-counter-lww-type` and `clear-field-9776`.

## Recommendation

**Option A with C's time rule, in steps.** It extends the existing generic
path (rule 12) and removes the store read behind #10385 instead of reordering
it for merge-eligible shapes. Every release applies its payload as a merge,
except for clears on v18.15.0–v18.21.x. B is the smaller change for
#10385 alone, but it leaves #10260, and a later resolver's snapshot still
erases. For #10260, A addresses only the readable-field shape, by construction;
no current pin shows it.

**Revert first?** #10385 is an unreleased regression from #10252, but
reverting #10252's crossing rule brings back #10214, which v19.1.0 has (per
#10385 and #10340). So it needs a fix forward (rule 15).

1. **PR 1:** pieces 1–3, including C's patch rule (the local delta rebased in
   place). Proof: #10385's E2E, a #10379 task E2E, and the restart after the
   time case. It covers #10385's reproduced shape (a readable done toggle).
   Queue item 3 still owns the fallback paths.
2. **PR 2:** the rest of C: fold losing deltas into replace snapshots, and the
   remote-win rule once designed (#10378).
3. **Separately, if decided:** admit NOTE, with `todayOrder` upkeep.

Opaque ops stay out of scope: each needs a per-action field contract, which
is rule 12's last resort. The remote-win half of #10260 for tasks waits for a
reproduction.

## Decisions for @johannesjo

1. **Direction:** A, B, or neither? If A, does #10385 ship as its PR 1?
2. **Recreate from a patch:** accept that a device which applied a concurrent
   delete recreates a TASK, PROJECT or TAG with defaults for the fields outside
   the patch, where today's replace recreates it fully?
3. **Clears on v18.15.0–v18.21.x:** accept that those receivers keep a stale
   optional value when a resolution becomes a patch? The alternative is to
   keep replace for resolutions that clear a field.
4. **NOTE:** admit it, accepting that a released device that applied a
   concurrent note delete recreates an invalid note that REPAIR must fix? Or
   keep notes on whole-entity LWW until v19.1.0 leaves the fleet?
5. **Resolution ops as input:** should a later conflict read a `'patch'`
   op's `actionPayload` as fields? That would end the no-re-merge contract.
6. **Opaque ops:** confirm that habit counts and `planTasksForToday` stay on
   whole-entity LWW for now.
7. **Time on a remote win:** re-apply the rebased local delta after a winning
   replace snapshot, or accept that #10378 is fixed only in the local-win
   direction?
