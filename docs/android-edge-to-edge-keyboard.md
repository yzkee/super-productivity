# Android edge-to-edge + soft keyboard (IME)

How the global add-task bar is positioned over the keyboard, and the full #8508
saga. **Read this before touching anything keyboard/IME-related on Android — this
area has regressed repeatedly (#8295, then #8508).**

## How the bar is positioned

The global add-task bar is `position: fixed` and lifted off the bottom by a CSS
variable only:

```scss
// add-task-bar.component.scss
:host-context(.isTouchOnly).global {
  bottom: calc(var(--keyboard-height) + var(--s2));
}
```

`--keyboard-height` defaults to `0px`. On Android/web it is set by
`GlobalThemeService._initVisualViewportKeyboardTracking()`
(`src/app/core/theme/global-theme.service.ts`) from
`obscured = window.innerHeight - visualViewport.height`, with a 100px floor
(`KEYBOARD_THRESHOLD_PX` — `obscured <= 100` is treated as `0`). On iOS the
Capacitor Keyboard plugin sets it.

So the bar floats above the keyboard if **either** the window/WebView shrinks
(then `bottom: 0` is already above the IME) **or** the visual viewport shrinks
(then `--keyboard-height` lifts the bar). On the devices we have tested, the
window **does** shrink (the system resizes for the IME), so `--keyboard-height`
stays `0` and the bar sits correctly at `bottom: var(--s2)`.

## #8508 — reversed / invisible characters (the actual root cause)

**Symptom.** On Android, the add-task bar (and search) showed reversed or
invisible characters; some users reported "I can't see what I'm writing and Enter
does nothing." Reported on v18.11.0 only (Pixel 10/Android 17, Galaxy S23 Ultra,
Pixel 8a, Tab S5e/Android 15).

**Root cause.** v18.11.0 shipped a `patch-package` patch (commit `5497212b9`) to
`@capawesome/capacitor-android-edge-to-edge-support` that **always** inset the
WebView by the IME height (`bottomMargin = max(imeInsets.bottom, …)` on every
`OnApplyWindowInsetsListener` callback), to fix the bar sitting _behind_ the
keyboard under _assumed_ enforced edge-to-edge.

On real devices the assumption is false: the system **still resizes the window
for the IME** even on Android 16. Measured on an Android 16 phone with the
keyboard up: `window.innerHeight` went **732 → 141** (and `--keyboard-height`
stayed `0`). The patch then added **another ~909px** inset on top of the already
shrunk window → the WebView was squashed to a ~141px sliver with a huge blank
gap above the keyboard. That squashed layout is almost certainly the
"can't see what I'm writing" report.

**Fix (this change).** The patch was **removed entirely**. The plugin's stock
behavior — `bottomMargin = keyboardVisible ? 0 : max(imeInsets.bottom, …)`, i.e.
no inset while the keyboard is up — lets the system handle the keyboard.
**Verified on an Android 16 phone: gap gone, WebView fills the resized window,
bar sits just above the keyboard (no behind-keyboard regression).**

## Theories that were RULED OUT (don't re-chase)

- **"Angular `ngModel` `writeValue` resets the caret during composition."**
  REFUTED. `NgModel`'s `isPropertyUpdated` guard skips `writeValue` while the
  model equals the just-typed value, and the add-task bar never touches
  `value`/`setSelectionRange`/`focus` mid-composition. Proven with an e2e CDP IME
  probe (since removed) and the unit specs.
- **"Per-keystroke DOM churn (signal updates) during composition."** Not the
  cause. On-device logging showed the WebView does **not** relayout during steady
  typing.
- **An SDK-version gate (inset only on API 36+) and an inset "latch."** Both
  tried and reverted. The gate is wrong because the Android 16 phone _resizes_
  (so it still double-counted there); the latch held a stale keyboard height and
  produced its own gap.

## Open items — if this is NOT fixed for the reporters

1. **Confirm the "reversed characters" symptom on the reporters' devices.** The
   squashed-WebView / gap is verified fixed on the maintainer's Android 16 phone.
   It is **not yet confirmed** that the _reversal_ is gone for all reporters
   (Pixel 10/A17, S23, Pixel 8a, Tab S5e). Ask them to test the next build.
2. **Residual: the system itself resizes on suggestion-strip changes.** Even with
   the patch gone, the logs show the IME inset oscillating (`imeBottom 909↔996`)
   as the suggestion strip toggles — and the _system_ resizes the window each
   time. Typing during that system resize could still disrupt composition. This
   is Android's own `adjustResize`, not our code. If reports persist, this is the
   next lead (e.g. a content-stable layout, or debouncing).
3. **The other v18.11.0 change.** If the reversal persists with the patch gone,
   re-examine the `@angular/* 21.2.11 → 21.2.17` bump (commit `f51954f80`) — the
   only other IME-adjacent change in the release.
4. **Long-term proper fix.** Removing the patch only puts the bar behind the
   keyboard on a device that enforces edge-to-edge **and** whose _visual_ viewport
   also fails to shrink for the IME — otherwise `--keyboard-height` still lifts
   the bar. That is cosmetic and likely rare, vs. the squashed layout on every
   real device tested. The correct inset would be **resize-detecting**: only inset
   when the window did not already shrink for the IME. Web-side detection already
   exists — `GlobalThemeService._isVisualViewportResizedForKeyboard()` — so a
   future native inset can reuse that logic rather than re-derive it. Validate on
   the device matrix below.
5. **Re-enable diagnostics.** Add `android.util.Log.d("SP8508", …)` in
   `EdgeToEdge.applyInsetsInternal` logging `kbVisible` / `imeBottom` /
   `bottomMargin` / whether a relayout fired, then `adb -d logcat -s SP8508`.
   On the web side, `chrome://inspect` →
   `{innerH: innerHeight, vvH: visualViewport.height, kb: getComputedStyle(document.documentElement).getPropertyValue('--keyboard-height')}`.

## What NOT to do

Do not stack a second/third keyboard-height source on top of the VisualViewport
signal (native physical-px height + a `baseInnerHeight`-tracking path combined as
`max(obscured, nativeKeyboardHeight - layoutShrink)`). That was #8295; the
sources race on separate async events, the baseline gets reset to the shrunk
`innerHeight` mid-animation, the double-count guard collapses, and the bar is
mispositioned. It was reverted. Fix the inset at the source, and **only after
detecting** whether the system already resized.

## Device test matrix (required before merging IME changes)

Behavior differs across devices — test the add-task bar opening the keyboard, and
typing a word fast right after tapping +, on:

- Android 10 (API 29) — pre-edge-to-edge; `Type.ime()` insets are unreliable here
- Android 14 (API 34) — edge-to-edge opt-out still possible
- Android 15 (API 35) — we opt out via `windowOptOutEdgeToEdgeEnforcement`
- Android 16 (API 36) — our target; the system was observed to still resize for
  the IME on a real device

Both gesture-nav and 3-button-nav, light and dark. Confirm: no blank gap above
the keyboard, bar visible just above the keyboard, and typed characters appear in
order (not reversed).
