# How to Rate ***Super Productivity***

### Why only 5-star reviews help (unfortunately)

Most app store algorithms and ranking systems heavily weight 5-star ratings when calculating overall visibility and trustworthiness.
Lower ratings, even if positive, dilute the average score and reduce how often the app is recommended or featured.

This leads to the weird situation that a well-intentioned and fair 4-star rating (after all, who is perfect?), *does* actually hurt.
