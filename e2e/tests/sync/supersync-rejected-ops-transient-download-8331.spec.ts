/**
 * Regression: transient download failure during rejected-ops resolution must
 * NOT permanently drop the user's pending local edit. (#8331)
 *
 * Background: when an upload is rejected with CONFLICT_CONCURRENT, the client
 * downloads remote ops to resolve the conflict. A network blip during that
 * nested download used to call markRejected() on the still-pending local op —
 * which is terminal (rejectedAt is never cleared), so the edit stayed applied
 * locally but never reached other devices. The fix leaves the op pending so it
 * re-resolves on the next sync.
 *
 * Discriminator: after the blip, B's pending edit must NOT be terminally
 * rejected (op-log has zero rejectedAt ops) — with the bug the catch called
 * markRejected() so that count is >= 1. End-to-end: once the fault clears, B's
 * edit resolves and both clients converge to the same title; with the bug B's
 * edit is dropped and the clients diverge.
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 * - super-sync-server running on localhost:1901 with TEST_MODE=true
 * - Frontend running on localhost:4242
 *
 * Run with: npm run e2e:supersync:file e2e/tests/sync/supersync-rejected-ops-transient-download-8331.spec.ts

      //
      //    The sync engine downloads before it uploads (sync-wrapper.service:
      //    downloadRemoteOps → uploadPendingOps). So if A's concurrent edit is
      //    already on the server when B syncs, B downloads and MERGES it during
      //    the pre-upload download, then uploads a dominating op the server
      //    ACCEPTS (200) — the upload-rejection path the fix guards is never
      //    reached. That race is exactly what flaked this test (run
      //    27465357634: B's upload returned 200, no resolution download fired,
      //    so abortedResolutionGets was 0). Pre-syncing A here is therefore the
      //    bug, not the setup.
      //
      //    Force the one ordering that guarantees a rejection: let B's
      //    pre-upload download run while the server still has NO concurrent op
      //    (A has not synced yet), then land A's edit in the window between B's
      //    download and B's upload by syncing A *inside* B's held upload POST.
      //    When B's POST is released the server holds A's concurrent op and
      //    rejects B's upload CONFLICT_CONCURRENT — and because B never merged,
      //    B's ORIGINAL pending edit is what rides into the resolution path.
      //    (Holding the POST is safe: the web fetch path has no client-side
      //    request timeout — connect/read timeouts apply only to native HTTP.)
      //
      //    The handler then downloads remote ops (GET) to resolve; fail EVERY
      //    post-upload GET, not just one: the provider retries transient fetch
      //    failures (SUPERSYNC_WEB_MAX_RETRIES), so a single abort would be
      //    silently recovered and never reach the catch the fix touches.
      //    The glob must match the real ops URLs (`/api/sync/ops` and
      //    `/api/sync/ops?<query>`) — `**/api/sync/ops/**` would match NEITHER
