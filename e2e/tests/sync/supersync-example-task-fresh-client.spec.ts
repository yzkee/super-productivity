/**
 * Regression test for #7976 — a fresh client's first-run example tasks must not trip the
 * SYNC_IMPORT conflict gate when pulling an account that already has data.
 *
 * THE BUG: ExampleTasksService creates onboarding task-create ops on first run. When a
 * fresh client then syncs an account that already has remote data, those pending ops used
 * to make the conflict gate treat the client as having meaningful local work, so it showed
 * a `dialog-sync-import-conflict` instead of silently accepting the import.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GUARDS: the op-log `isExampleTask` marker + gate exclusion. It does NOT
 * exercise the afterInitialSyncDoneStrict$ timing — on a fresh e2e client sync is disabled
 * at boot, so example tasks are created before sync is configured regardless of the strict
 * gate; the marker is what suppresses the dialog here. Covering the strict-wait timing
 * needs a client with sync pre-enabled at boot (a separate test).
 *
 * METHOD: configure sync with `waitForInitialSync: false` so setupSuperSync does NOT
 * auto-resolve the conflict dialog (it otherwise clicks "Use Server Data"), then race
 * "conflict dialog visible" against "sync complete". The fix means sync completes WITHOUT
 * the dialog; pre-fix the dialog wins the race.
 *
 * REPRODUCE-FIRST: expected to FAIL on `bb4b625645^` (race resolves to 'dialog') and PASS
 * on the PR head. Run on both before trusting it.
 *
 * Run: npm run e2e:supersync:file e2e/tests/sync/supersync-example-task-fresh-client.spec.ts -- --retries=0
