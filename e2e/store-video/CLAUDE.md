# Marketing reel pipeline

Playwright-driven generation of the marketing gif/video for the landing page and GitHub README. Mirrors the screenshot pipeline (`e2e/store-screenshots/`) — same fixture/seed plumbing, similar npm-script shape.

## Run

```bash
npm run video         # tight default (~17s) → dist/video/reel*.{mp4,webm,gif}
npm run video:full    # full variant (~21s) → dist/video/reel-full*.{...}
npm run video:ms-store # 16:9 Store trailer → dist/video/reel-ms-store.mp4 + thumbnail

# under the hood
npm run video:capture # Playwright records to .tmp/video/recordings/<variant>/
npm run video:build   # ffmpeg → dist/video/, picks the most recent webm
npm run video:open    # opens an autoplay browser preview, skips in CI
```

`REEL_VARIANT=<name>` switches the spec branch and adds a filename suffix so multiple variants coexist in `dist/video/`. `full` uses the longer choreography. `ms-store` reuses the tight choreography but captures at 1920×1080 and builds only the Microsoft Store trailer assets.

Variant recordings are isolated under `.tmp/video/recordings/<variant>/` (`default`, `full`, `ms-store`, …) so `video:build` can't accidentally reuse a recording from a different aspect ratio.

`gifsicle` is optional — the build script falls back to ffmpeg's gif if it's missing. With it installed, you also get `reel-optimized.gif` (~30% smaller).

## Files

| File                                 | Responsibility                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `playwright.store-video.config.ts`   | Single chromium project, `video: 'off'` at project level (the fixture handles `recordVideo` itself because `browser.newContext()` doesn't inherit `use.video`).                                                                             |
| `store-video/fixture.ts`             | Custom context with `recordVideo` enabled at 1024×1024 / DPR 2, or 1920×1080 / DPR 1 for `REEL_VARIANT=ms-store`. Reuses the screenshot pipeline's seed builder. Init scripts handle: cursor highlight ring, dialog/snack/tooltip/mention suppression, app zoom. |
| `store-video/overlays.ts`            | DOM-injected overlay primitives: `showOverlay`, `showCaption`, `showIntegrationsCard`, `showEndCard`, `cutToScene`, `fadeTransition`, `loopBoundary`, `attachDragGhost`, `smoothMouseMove`. Plus inline brand SVGs in the `LOGOS` constant. |
| `store-video/scenarios/reel.spec.ts` | Six-beat choreography. `REEL_VARIANT=full` triggers the optional "No account. No tracking." beat and relaxes hold timings.                                                                                                                  |
| `store-video/build-video.ts`         | Picks the most recent `.webm` under `.tmp/video/recordings/`, applies the trim sidecar (cuts the seed-import lead-in), produces mp4/webm/gif via ffmpeg, optionally `gifsicle`-optimizes. For `ms-store`, produces a 1920×1080 H.264/AAC MP4 and PNG thumbnail. |
| `store-video/open-video.ts`          | Opens an autoplay browser preview after `npm run video`. Prefers mp4, respects `REEL_VARIANT`, seeks slightly past the black first frame for preview only, and skips auto-open in CI.                                                       |

## Beat structure (current)

```
Lead-in   black fades to SP UI with schedule day-panel already open
1  Capture in seconds.        global add-task-bar; types
                              "A task 1h" with 55ms keystroke delay.
                              Captured task carries through to beats 2 and 3.
1.5 [full only]               No account. No tracking.
2  Plan your day.             drags the newly captured "A task" item onto
                              the schedule panel with the app's native CDK

3  Focus on what matters.     dispatches `[Task] SetCurrentTask` /
                              `[FocusMode] Show Overlay` /
                              `[FocusMode] Start Session` directly via
                              `__e2eTestHelpers.store`. `clock.runFor(5500)`
                              skips the 5s countdown; `clock.resume()` lets
                              the timer tick during the hold.

## Scene transitions

The main reel uses two transition styles:

1. `cutToScene(page, async () => { ... })` for app state changes and bigger app-to-screen jumps. It fades a max-z-index black overlay in, runs setup while black covers the app, then fades back out. Beat 1 → 2 closes the add-task-bar by clicking the real backdrop inside this covered callback, so list reflow and cursor reset are hidden before the drag starts. Pass a `label` to log how long setup spent behind black.
2. Direct card crossfade for controlled full-screen cards. Beat 4 → 5 shows the end card above the integrations card, then hides the integrations card underneath once the end card is mostly opaque.

**Always pass `noWait: true` to the next overlay/card inside a `cutToScene` callback.** Without it, the call awaits its own fade-in (and stagger animation, for `showIntegrationsCard`/`showEndCard`) — which would play behind the still-opaque black and be wasted. With `noWait`, the call returns as soon as the DOM is in place, so the fade-in animates concurrently with `cutToScene`'s fade-from-black. The viewer sees: scene → black → next-scene-emerging-with-its-animation.

`fadeTransition` remains available in `overlays.ts`, but keep it out of the drag setup path: its transparent dim can let underlying app reflow leak through and make the first drag frames look wrong.

## Architecture decisions / gotchas

**Trim sidecar.** The recording necessarily includes ~14s of seed-import navigation before the choreography starts. The fixture stamps `recordingState.startMs` at context creation; the spec calls `markBeatsStart()` when ready; the delta lands in `.tmp/video/recordings/_latest-trim.json` and ffmpeg `-ss` skips past it. **Don't try to inject the seed via IndexedDB** — the addInitScript timing race vs. SP's IDB-read is genuinely unsafe and the trim sidecar handles host-speed variance correctly.

**Page clock.** `page.clock.install({ time: SCREENSHOT_BASE_DATE })` is on by default (inherited from screenshot fixture). This freezes `Date.now`, `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and `requestAnimationFrame` in the page until you call `clock.runFor(ms)` or `clock.resume()`. Beat 3 calls `runFor(5500)` to skip the 5s focus-mode countdown, then `resume()` so the running timer ticks naturally and end-card stat counters animate (they use rAF).

**Material snack bars and dialogs.** Hidden via CSS in the fixture init script (`.cdk-overlay-pane:has(.mat-mdc-dialog-container)`, `.mat-mdc-snack-bar-container`, plus `mention-list`, `.mention-menu`, `.add-task-bar-panel`). With the clock installed, snack auto-dismiss timers don't fire on their own — hiding them is cleaner than waiting. focus-mode-overlay isn't a mat-dialog so it's unaffected.

**App zoom.** `app-root { zoom: 1.4 }` in fixture init "zooms in" on the SP UI without shrinking the recording canvas. At 1.4 the inner viewport for the layout is 1024/1.4 ≈ 731px — enough for the work-view + collapsed sidenav + 240-wide right panel without clipping. Earlier 1.5 was cropping the right edge of the work view. Earlier 1.4 iterations _also_ stacked `transform: scale(1.45)` on the add-task-bar, but that compounded badly with the zoom and clipped past the viewport — letting `app-root zoom` do the work alone is simpler. Overlays are siblings of `app-root` in the DOM tree (appended to `body`), so they're unaffected by this zoom — design overlay sizes against the un-zoomed viewport.

**Schedule day-panel width.** Pre-seeded in `ONBOARDING_INIT` via `localStorage.setItem('SUP_RIGHT_PANEL_WIDTH', '250')` — that's `RIGHT_PANEL_CONFIG.MIN_WIDTH`, the smallest the panel allows before its 200px CLOSE_THRESHOLD kicks in. Pre-seeding through the panel's own persistence path means the inner schedule grid computes its column widths against 250 and the event blocks don't overflow. Earlier iterations forced `width !important` on `.side`, which sized the chrome but didn't propagate to the grid — events then spilled past the panel's right edge and required ugly `overflow-x: hidden` belt-and-braces clips. Don't go that route.

**Add-task-bar overlays.** The fixture only hides the _overlay surfaces_ that pop on top of the bar while typing (mat-autocomplete suggestions, mention-list, loading spinner) — those would otherwise read as glitchy white boxes mid-gif. The bar itself is not styled by the fixture; it uses its real `:host` rules. Beat 1 → 2 closes it by clicking the real `.backdrop`, matching normal UI behavior instead of dispatching layout state directly.

**Cursor highlight.** Soft white radial-gradient ring at `z-index: 2147483640`, follows mousemove. Toggle visibility per-beat via `body.__sp-hide-cursor-highlight` — used during the capture beat where the focused input would otherwise show the ring as a stray dot.

**Main-text consistency.** `.__sp-video-overlay-text`, `.__sp-video-int-card-title`, `.__sp-video-end-card-title` share a single rule with `font-size: clamp(48px, 6.4vw, 96px) !important`. The `!important` flag is required because `.mat-typography h1` has specificity (0,1,1) which outranks our class-only selector. Card titles are `<p>` rather than `<h1>` for belt-and-braces — even with `!important`, the typography font shorthand can sneak through.

**Drag preview.** Beat 2 intentionally does not use a synthetic video ghost. It relies on the app's real CDK drag behavior so the visual preview matches what a user sees while dragging a task onto the schedule panel. Keep the source locator tied to `CAPTURED_TASK_DISPLAY_TITLE`; using `task().first()` can accidentally drag a larger seeded task and make the preview look zoomed.

**Loop boundary.** `loopBoundary(page, 'in', ms)` shows full-black opacity 1 then fades to 0 over `ms` (lead-in). `loopBoundary(page, 'out', ms)` fades from 0 to 1 (closing). Gif seam is black-to-black, no jump cut. `z-index: 2147483647` (max safe) so it covers everything including end card.

**Output cadence.** Playwright's recorder emits 25fps webm in this pipeline. `build-video.ts` keeps MP4, WebM, and GIF at 25fps to avoid duplicate/drop-frame judder during fades and cursor movement.

**Microsoft Store variant.** `npm run video:ms-store` sets `REEL_VARIANT=ms-store`, records at 1920×1080, and emits:

- `dist/video/reel-ms-store.mp4` — H.264 High Profile, yuv420p, 50 Mbps target, BT.709 color tags, closed GOP, 2 B-frames, fast-start MP4, plus AAC-LC stereo at 48 kHz with a 384 kbps encoder target.
- `dist/video/reel-ms-store-thumbnail.png` — 1920×1080 PNG frame from 1.2s into the finished trailer.

This variant follows Microsoft Partner Center's app trailer requirements: MP4/MOV, 1920×1080 video, PNG thumbnail at 1920×1080, title under 255 chars, and no age-rating bumper inside the trailer. The build validates the generated MP4/PNG with `ffprobe` and fails on wrong size, codec, profile, scan type, color tags, missing audio, or an over-2GB file.

Optional Store env vars:

- `MS_STORE_AUDIO_SOURCE=path/to/audio.ext` loops a real audio bed under the trailer. Without it, the trailer gets silent AAC-LC stereo; ffmpeg's native AAC encoder reports very low probed bitrate for pure silence even with a 384 kbps encoder target, so the build prints a warning.
- `MS_STORE_THUMBNAIL_AT_SECONDS=2.4` chooses a different thumbnail frame from the finished MP4.

**Build script picks most-recent webm.** No need to clean `.tmp/video/recordings/` between runs. Old webms accumulate but only the most recent `.mtime` is built into outputs.

**Variant filename suffix.** `build-video.ts` reads `process.env.REEL_VARIANT` and appends `-${variant}` to all output filenames when set. `npm run video:full` works because env vars propagate through `npm run`.

## Iteration loop

1. Edit `reel.spec.ts` (copy, beat order, durations) or `overlays.ts` (visual styling).
2. `npm run checkFile <path>` on every changed `.ts` file (per project CLAUDE.md).
3. `npm run video` — capture (~32s) + build (~10s).
4. Open `dist/video/reel-optimized.gif`.

**Don't** put backticks inside CSS comments in template literals — they're parsed as nested template expressions and break TypeScript. Multiple iterations have stumbled on this.

**Don't** use mixed `+`/`*` operators without parentheses in spec coordinates — eslint `no-mixed-operators` will fail. Use intermediate `const` or wrap in parens.

## Open polish ideas (not yet shipped)

- **Theme + locale matrix.** Fixture supports both via `test.use({ theme, locale })`. Add Playwright projects per variant; matrix run produces `reel-en-dark.gif`, `reel-en-light.gif`, etc. Mirrors the screenshot pipeline pattern.
- **Aspect ratio variants.** 9:16 (1080×1920) for mobile social. Different `VIDEO_SIZE` per matrix entry.
- **5-second social cut.** `npm run video:short` produces beats {1, 3, 5}. Trivial extension of the variant flag.
- **Drop-slot highlight.** Brief CSS pulse on the schedule slot the dragged task lands in — gives beat 2 a closing punctuation.
- **Brand-color flash on logo entrance.** Currently logos are flat brand colors. Could flash bright then settle.
- **End-card "Open the app →" CTA.** Chip-styled visual cue; not a real link.
- **Tighten further.** Current default lands at ~17s; could push to ~14s by tightening drag pause times.

## Coordinates with project-wide CLAUDE.md

Lives under `e2e/`, so `e2e/CLAUDE.md` rules also apply (test template, fixture conventions). Linting via `npm run checkFile` per the root project guidance. No translations affected — all overlay copy is hard-coded English in the spec for now.
