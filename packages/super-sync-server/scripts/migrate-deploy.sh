# Generic, name-agnostic Prisma migration deploy + recovery.
#
# Prisma 5.x wraps every migration in a transaction. PostgreSQL forbids
# CREATE/DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY inside a transaction block, so such a
# migration fails with P3018 / SQLSTATE 25001 ("cannot run inside a
# transaction block"), and a later deploy then refuses with P3009 (the
# migration is stuck in a failed state).
#
# This script applies migrations and, ONLY for that specific failure mode,
# recovers by running the failing migration's own SQL out-of-band (no
# transaction), then marks it applied and retries. It hardcodes no migration
# names: the failing migration is read from Prisma's own output and its SQL is
# read from prisma/migrations/<name>/migration.sql.
#
# This script is COPYed into the image next to prisma/migrations in the same
# build, so it is always version-locked to the migrations it must handle. All
# three call sites (host deploy.sh, image startup CMD, helm initContainer)
# invoke it, so it carries its own step timeout as defense-in-depth (deploy.sh
# also wraps it; the CMD/initContainer paths have no outer timeout).
#
# RECOVERABLE shape (only this is auto-recovered): a migration whose SQL
# contains BOTH a DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY and a CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY, so
# re-running it out-of-band is idempotent and clears a half-built INVALID index
# first:
#
#     DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS "x";
#     CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY "x" ON ...;
#
# A bare `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` (no DROP) is INTENTIONALLY not recovered:
# such migrations (e.g. 20260511000000) are written to fail loudly rather than
# be marked applied with a possibly-INVALID index. They fall through to a loud
# failure here by gate, deterministically.
#
# Statements must end with `;` at end of line, comments must be full-line `--`,
# and `;` must not appear inside string literals (true for all index DDL).
