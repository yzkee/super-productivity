      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>Last updated: December 9, 2025</p>
      <p class="note">
        Note: This is a translation for convenience only. In case of discrepancies between
        the German and the English version, the German version shall prevail.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By accessing or using the SuperSync service ("Service"), you agree to be bound by
        these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not
        access or use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
      <p>
        SuperSync is a data synchronization service designed to work with the Super
        Productivity application. It allows users to synchronize their task data across
        multiple devices. The Service is provided in its currently available version ("as
        available"). The Provider may further develop, modify, restrict, or discontinue
        the Service at any time.
      </p>

      <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
      <p>
        To use the Service, you must register for an account. You agree to provide
        accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to
        update such information to keep it accurate, current, and complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are responsible for safeguarding the password and access tokens that you use
        to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your account.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data Security and Encryption</h2>
      <p>
        Your use of the Service is also governed by our Privacy Policy. Data transmission
        is encrypted via TLS/SSL. By default, data is stored without end-to-end
        encryption.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may optionally enable End-to-End Encryption (E2EE). If enabled, your
        encryption keys are generated and managed locally by you.
        <strong>Warning:</strong> We have no access to these keys and cannot recover
        encrypted data if you lose your key. Loss of your encryption key results in
        permanent data loss.
      </p>
      <p>
        Backups are performed on a best-effort basis. You are obligated to create regular
        local backup copies of your data.
      </p>

      <h2>5. User Obligations</h2>
      <p>You agree:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Not to misuse the Service (e.g., attacks, excessive load, circumvention of
          security mechanisms)
        </li>
        <li>
          Not to upload illegal content, malware, or third-party data without
          authorization
        </li>
        <li>
          To make the choice of security level (with/without E2EE) independently based on
          the sensitivity of your data
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you violate these Terms and the Provider is held liable by third parties as a
        result, you shall indemnify the Provider against all related claims.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Future Pricing</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is currently provided free of charge. However, we reserve the right to
        introduce fees for the Service in the future. We will provide notice of any such
        changes before they become effective.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        You may delete your account at any time via the app settings, thereby terminating
        the contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        For free services, we may terminate the contractual relationship with a notice
        period of two (2) weeks. We may terminate or suspend your account immediately
        without notice only for good cause (e.g., violation of these Terms, illegal
        activities).
      </p>
      <p>For paid services, the notice periods stated in the order process apply.</p>

      <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may amend these Terms if necessary to adapt to technical developments, changes
        in legal frameworks, new functions, security requirements, or business models.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amendments will be communicated to you at least
        <strong>six (6) weeks</strong> before they take effect. The notification will
        include your right to object and your right to terminate the contract. If you do
        not object within the notice period, the amendments are deemed accepted.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        The Provider is liable without limitation in cases of intent, gross negligence,
        and culpable injury to life, body, or health.
      </p>
      <p>
        In cases of slight negligence, the Provider is only liable for the breach of
        essential contractual obligations. In these cases, liability is limited to the
        foreseeable damage typical for the contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Data Loss:</strong> Liability for data loss is limited to the effort that
        would have been required for recovery assuming proper, reasonable, and regular
        data backup by you. If you have not created sufficient backups, liability is
        excluded insofar as the damage would have been avoidable through backups.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>E2EE Data:</strong> The Provider is not liable for data loss, data
        corruption, or inaccessibility attributable to key loss, incorrect key management
        by you, or use of the optional E2EE function.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Right of Withdrawal for Consumers</h2>
      <p>
        If you are a consumer and conclude a paid contract, you are entitled to a
        statutory right of withdrawal of <strong>14 days</strong>. Details are regulated
        in the separate cancellation policy provided during the order process.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
      <p>
        The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies, excluding the UN Sales
        Convention (CISG). If you are a merchant, a legal entity under public law, or a
        special fund under public law, Leipzig is the exclusive place of jurisdiction.
        Statutory places of jurisdiction apply to consumers.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Online Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        Platform of the EU Commission for Online Dispute Resolution:
        <a
          href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The Provider is not obligated and not willing to participate in dispute resolution
        proceedings before a consumer arbitration board.
      </p>
