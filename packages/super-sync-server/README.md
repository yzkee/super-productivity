# SuperSync Server

A custom, high-performance synchronization server for Super Productivity.

> **Note:** This server implements a custom operation-based synchronization protocol (Event Sourcing), **not** WebDAV. It is designed specifically for the Super Productivity client's efficient sync requirements.

## Architecture

The server uses an **Append-Only Log** architecture backed by **PostgreSQL** (via Prisma):

1.  **Operations**: Clients upload atomic operations (Create, Update, Delete, Move).
2.  **Sequence Numbers**: The server assigns a strictly increasing `server_seq` to each operation.
3.  **Synchronization**: Clients request "all operations since sequence `X`".
4.  **Snapshots**: The server can regenerate the full state by replaying operations, optimizing initial syncs.

### Key Design Principles

| Principle                           | Description                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Server-Authoritative**            | Server assigns monotonic sequence numbers for total ordering              |
| **Client-Side Conflict Resolution** | Server stores operations as-is; clients detect and resolve conflicts      |
| **E2E Encryption Support**          | Payloads can be encrypted client-side; server treats them as opaque blobs |
| **Idempotent Uploads**              | Request ID deduplication prevents duplicate operations                    |

## Quick Start

### Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the server is using the provided Docker Compose configuration.

```bash
# 1. Copy environment example
cp env.example .env

# 2. Configure .env (Set JWT_SECRET, DOMAIN, POSTGRES_PASSWORD)
nano .env

# 3. Deploy the stack and run database migrations
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

`docker compose up` is not a deployment substitute: container startup migrations
are disabled by default so app restarts cannot race the deploy migrator.

> **Upgrade note:** after this change, `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`
> can leave the app running against unapplied migrations. Use `./scripts/deploy.sh`
> for production updates, or `./scripts/deploy.sh --build` for local image builds.

Large optional indexes are built outside Prisma migrations. Run the deploy
off-hours with `RUN_POST_MIGRATION_INDEXES=true` to build them.

Older databases that saw the original `20260511000000_add_entity_sequence_index`
migration may warn that the applied migration file changed. Prisma's production
`migrate deploy` command reports modified applied migrations as warnings and then
continues to apply pending migrations. Do not reset a production database for
this warning; this migration now intentionally contains no SQL, and the physical
index is managed by `deploy.sh`.

If `DATABASE_URL` points to an external PostgreSQL server, set
`POSTGRES_SERVICE=` to the empty value. `deploy.sh` then starts only the
app/proxy services with compose dependencies disabled so the bundled Postgres
container is not required. The deploy script still runs Prisma migrations, known
failed-migration recovery, and optional index builds through the configured
`DATABASE_URL`.

If you need to recover an external database manually, drop any invalid partial
index, roll back the failed Prisma migration row, and then rebuild the optional
index off-hours. Run the SQL with the same schema/search path used by
`DATABASE_URL`:

```sql
-- Replace public if DATABASE_URL uses a different Prisma schema/search path.
SET search_path TO public;
DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS "operations_user_id_entity_type_entity_id_server_seq_idx";
```

```bash
npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back 20260511000000_add_entity_sequence_index
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

```sql
-- Replace public if DATABASE_URL uses a different Prisma schema/search path.
SET search_path TO public;
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS "operations_user_id_entity_type_entity_id_server_seq_idx"
  ON "operations"("user_id", "entity_type", "entity_id", "server_seq");
```

Because that optional index is intentionally managed outside Prisma, do not run
Prisma schema reset/push commands against a production-shaped database to "fix"
the difference. Those commands can drop the out-of-band index.

### Manual Setup (Development)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate

# Set up .env
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env to point to your PostgreSQL instance (DATABASE_URL)

# Push schema to DB
npx prisma db push

# Start the server
npm run dev

# Or build and run
npm run build
npm start
```

## Configuration

All configuration is done via environment variables.

| `DATABASE_URL` | -                                    | PostgreSQL connection string (e.g. `postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/db`)  |
| `JWT_SECRET`   | -                                    | **Required.** Secret for signing JWTs (min 32 chars)                            |
| `PUBLIC_URL`   | -                                    | **Required.** Public URL used for email links (e.g. `https://sync.example.com`) |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `https://app.super-productivity.com` | Allowed CORS origins                                                            |
| `SMTP_HOST`    | -                                    | SMTP Server for emails                                                          |

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

#### Register a new user

```http
POST /api/register

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "message": "User registered. Please verify your email.",

### Synchronization

All sync endpoints require Bearer authentication: `Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>`

#### 1. Upload Operations

Send new changes to the server.

```http
POST /api/sync/ops
```

#### 2. Download Operations

Get changes from other devices.

```http
GET /api/sync/ops?sinceSeq=123
```

#### 3. Get Snapshot

Get the full current state (optimized).

```http
GET /api/sync/snapshot
```

#### 4. Sync Status

```http
GET /api/sync/status
```

## Client Configuration

In Super Productivity, configure the Custom Sync provider with:

- **Base URL**: `https://sync.your-domain.com` (or your deployed URL)
- **Auth Token**: JWT token from login

## Maintenance

### Scripts

The server includes scripts for administrative tasks. These use the configured database.

```bash
# Delete a user account
npm run delete-user -- user@example.com

# Clear sync data (preserves account)
npm run clear-data -- user@example.com

# Clear ALL sync data (dangerous)
npm run clear-data -- --all
```

## Multi-Instance Deployment Considerations

When deploying multiple server instances behind a load balancer, be aware of these limitations:

### Passkey Challenge Storage

**Issue**: WebAuthn challenges are stored in an in-memory Map, which doesn't work across instances.

**Symptom**: Passkey registration/login fails if the challenge generation request hits instance A but verification hits instance B.

**Solution for multi-instance**:

- Implement Redis-backed challenge storage
- Or use sticky sessions (less ideal)

**Current status**: A warning is logged at startup in production if in-memory storage is used.

### Snapshot Generation Locks

**Issue**: Concurrent snapshot generation prevention uses an in-memory Map.

**Symptom**: Same user may trigger duplicate snapshot computations across different instances.

**Impact**: Performance only (no data corruption) - snapshots are deterministic.

**Solution for multi-instance**:

- Implement Redis distributed lock (optional, only for performance)

### Single-Instance Deployment

For single-instance deployments, these limitations do not apply. The current implementation is fully functional and well-tested for single-instance use.

## Security Notes

- **Set JWT_SECRET** to a secure random value in production (min 32 characters).
- **Use HTTPS in production**. The Docker setup includes Caddy to handle this automatically.
- **Restrict CORS origins** in production.
- **Database backups** are recommended for production deployments.
