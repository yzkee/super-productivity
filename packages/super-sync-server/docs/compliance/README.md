## Next Steps (Action Plan)

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

**Priority 1: Verify Infrastructure Security** ⭐ **READY TO SEND**

- [ ] **Start here:** Read `NEXT-STEPS-ALFAHOSTING-VERIFICATION.md` for complete instructions
- [ ] Send email to Alfahosting using `ALFAHOSTING-EMAIL-TEMPLATE.md`
- [ ] Track response in `ALFAHOSTING-RESPONSE-TRACKER.md`
- [ ] Obtain confirmation on encryption at rest
- [ ] Verify AVV (Data Processing Agreement) is current
- [ ] Confirm data location (Germany only)
- [ ] Document responses in checklist
- [ ] Update compliance documents with findings

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes to send + 2-5 business days wait + 1 hour to process response

**Priority 2: Test User Flows**

- [ ] Test E2EE warning display in app (enable E2EE in sync settings)
- [ ] Verify warning is clear and prominent

## Key Findings and Recommendations

### Strengths (What's Done Well)

1. **Privacy by Design:**
   - Optional E2EE with zero-knowledge architecture
   - No analytics or tracking
   - Minimal data collection
   - Local-first architecture

2. **User Control:**
   - Users can delete account anytime
   - Data export functionality (portability)
   - Can disable sync without losing data

3. **Security:**
   - Strong encryption (HTTPS/TLS, bcrypt, E2EE)
   - Rate limiting and account lockout
   - Email verification required
   - Security headers implemented

4. **Transparency:**
   - Open source (auditable)
   - Clear privacy policy
   - No hidden data collection

### Weaknesses (What Needs Work)

1. **Breach Detection:**
   - No automated security monitoring
   - Limited audit logging
   - Recommendation: Implement IDS and enhanced logging

2. **Operational Documentation:**
   - No formal incident response testing (yet)
   - No data subject request log (yet)
   - Recommendation: Set up processes and test them

3. **Infrastructure Verification:**
   - Encryption at rest not confirmed
   - Backup procedures not documented
   - Recommendation: Complete Alfahosting verification checklist
