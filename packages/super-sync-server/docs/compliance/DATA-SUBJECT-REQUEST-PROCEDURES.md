- Ask for recent activity details (e.g., last task created)

### Verification Template

```

Support team can also extract:

- Database query for user's operations

**STEP 2: Prepare Access Report**
Create document containing:

## 4.2 Right to Erasure (Article 17)

### What Happens

- Account and all associated data deleted

- Cascading delete in database

### Implementation

**STEP 1: Verify No Legal Obligation to Retain**
Check if any data must be retained:

- ❌ Tax records: NOT APPLICABLE (no paid accounts yet)
- ❌ Legal claims: NOT APPLICABLE (no ongoing disputes)
- ✅ OK to delete

**STEP 2: User Can Self-Serve**
In app:

- Settings > Account > Delete Account
- Confirmation dialog
- Immediate deletion

OR Support team uses CLI:

```bash
npm run delete-user -- user@example.com
```

**STEP 3: Verify Deletion**
Check database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
-- Should return no results
```

**STEP 4: Send Confirmation**

```
Subject: Account Deletion Confirmation - [Request ID]

Dear [User],

Your Super Productivity Sync account has been deleted as requested.

Deleted:
- Account information (email, password hash)
- All sync operations and snapshots
- All device records
- All associated data

Timeline:
- Database deletion: Immediate
- Backup purge: Within 7 days (standard backup rotation)

Your data is no longer accessible and will be fully purged from all systems within 7 days.

If you created a new account with the same email, it will be treated as a new account with no connection to the deleted account.

Thank you for using Super Productivity Sync.

Best regards,
Super Productivity Sync Team
```

**Timeline:** Immediate (acknowledge within 1 month)

### Exceptions to Erasure Right

Decline erasure request if:

- Legal obligation to retain data (e.g., tax records for paid accounts)
- Necessary for legal claims or defense
- Public interest (Not applicable to Super Sync)

**Template for Declining:**

```
We cannot delete your data at this time because [reason, e.g., "we are legally required to retain billing records for 10 years under German tax law"].

However, we can restrict processing of your data. Please let us know if you would like to proceed with restriction instead of erasure.
```

## 4.3 Right to Rectification (Article 16)

### What User Can Do

Correct inaccurate or incomplete data.

### Implementation

**STEP 1: Identify Data to Correct**

- Email address
- User content (tasks, projects, notes)

**STEP 2: User Can Self-Serve**
For most data:

- User updates data directly in app (sync operations handle corrections)

For email address change:

- [To be implemented: Email change feature with verification]
- Currently: Delete account and re-register (workaround)

**STEP 3: Send Confirmation**

```
Subject: Data Rectification Completed - [Request ID]

Dear [User],

We have corrected your personal data as requested.

Updated:
- [List what was corrected]

Your updated data is now reflected in your account.

Best regards,
Super Productivity Sync Team
```

**Timeline:** Within 1 month

---

## 4.4 Right to Restriction of Processing (Article 18)

### What Happens

Limit processing while dispute resolved or user objects.

### Implementation

**STEP 1: Assess Reason for Restriction**

- User contests accuracy (restrict while verifying)
- Processing unlawful but user doesn't want erasure
- Controller no longer needs data but user needs it for legal claim
- User objects to processing (restrict while assessing objection)

**STEP 2: Implement Restriction**

**Option 1: User Disables Sync**

- User turns off sync in app settings
- Data remains stored but not actively processed

**Option 2: Support Team Flags Account**

- Add "restricted" flag to user account in database
- Document reason for restriction
- No new sync operations processed

**STEP 3: Send Confirmation**

```
Subject: Processing Restriction Applied - [Request ID]

Dear [User],

We have restricted processing of your personal data as requested.

Restriction Details:
- Sync operations: Paused
- Data storage: Retained but not actively processed
- Duration: Until [condition, e.g., "dispute resolved"]

You can reactivate processing by [action, e.g., "re-enabling sync in settings"].

Best regards,
Super Productivity Sync Team
```

**Timeline:** Within 1 month

## 4.5 Right to Data Portability (Article 20)

**Timeline:** Within 1 month

---

## 4.6 Right to Object (Article 21)

### What User Can Do

Object to processing based on legitimate interests.

### Implementation

**STEP 1: Assess Objection**

- Is processing based on legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f))? → Yes for server logs
- Does objection relate to direct marketing? → NOT APPLICABLE (no marketing)

**STEP 2: Evaluate Objection**

- Can we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that override user's interests?
- Example: Security logs needed to prevent fraud

**STEP 3: Respond**

If objection accepted:

```
We have stopped processing your data for [specific purpose].

Actions taken:
- [List actions, e.g., "Stopped logging your IP address"]
```

If objection declined:

```
We must continue processing your data for [specific purpose] because [compelling legitimate grounds, e.g., "security logs are necessary to prevent fraud and unauthorized access, which protects all users including yourself"].

You have the right to lodge a complaint with the Sächsischer Datenschutzbeauftragter (saechsdsb@slt.sachsen.de) if you disagree with this decision.
```

**Timeline:** Within 1 month

---

## 4.7 Notification Obligation (Article 19)

### What It Means

If we rectify, erase, or restrict data, we must notify recipients of that data.

### Implementation

**STEP 1: Identify Recipients**
For Super Sync:

- Alfahosting (hosting provider) - changes automatically reflected
- No other recipients

**STEP 2: Notify Recipients** (If Applicable)
Not required for Alfahosting (automated cascading delete).

If third-party integrations added in future:

- Email third parties: "User [X] has requested data deletion, please remove from your systems"
- Track confirmation of deletion

**Currently:** NO ACTION NEEDED (no third-party recipients)
