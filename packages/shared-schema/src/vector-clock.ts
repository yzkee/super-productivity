/**
 * Vector Clock types and comparison functions for distributed synchronization.
 *
 * A vector clock is a data structure used to determine the partial ordering of events
 * in a distributed system and detect causality violations.
 *
 * Each process/device maintains its own component in the vector, incrementing it
 * on local updates. This allows us to determine if two states are:
 * - EQUAL: Same vector values
 * - LESS_THAN: A happened before B
 * - GREATER_THAN: B happened before A
 * - CONCURRENT: Neither happened before the other (true conflict)
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This module is shared between client and server.
 * Any changes must be compatible with both environments.
